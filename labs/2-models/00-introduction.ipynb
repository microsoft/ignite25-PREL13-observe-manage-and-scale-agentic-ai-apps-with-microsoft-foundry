    "\n",
    "Cora needs to recommend home improvement products from Zava's catalog effectively. But which AI model should power Cora? Should we use GPT-4.1 for its advanced reasoning, or GPT-4o-mini for cost efficiency?\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Challenge**: Before deploying Cora to production, we need to evaluate different models to find the best balance of quality, speed, and cost. We also need realistic test data to compare how each model performs with customer queries.\n",

    "\n",
    "**1. Early Testing**\n",
    "- Test models before deployment\n",
    "- Catch issues in development\n",
    "- Iterate quickly on improvements\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Comprehensive Coverage**\n",
    "- Generate hundreds of test cases quickly\n",
    "- Cover edge cases humans might miss\n",
    "- Test different customer intents and phrasings\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Privacy & Safety**\n",

    "**Without RAG (model alone):**\n",

    "1. Retrieve: Search product database for \"PFIP000002\"\n",
    "   → Found: \"Premium Exterior Paint, $45.99, In Stock\"\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. Augment: Add retrieved info to prompt\n",
    "   \"Based on this product info: [Premium Exterior Paint...], answer the question\"\n",

    "## The Model Selection Process\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 1: Define Requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ask yourself:**\n",
    "- What is my task? (Q&A, recommendations, complex reasoning)\n",
    "- What quality level is acceptable?\n",
    "- What's my budget?\n",
    "- What latency is acceptable?\n",
    "- How many queries per day?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example for Cora:**\n",
    "- Task: Product Q&A, inventory checks\n",
    "- Quality: High accuracy required (factual info)\n",
    "- Budget: Moderate (thousands of queries/day)\n",
    "- Latency: < 2 seconds preferred\n",
    "- Volume: ~5,000 queries/day\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 2: Generate Test Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "**Use Azure AI Simulator:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Generate 100 query-response pairs from product catalog\n",
    "dataset = simulator.generate(\n",
    "    target=rag_callback,\n",
    "    num_queries=100\n",
    ")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Save to JSONL\n",
    "with open(\"test_dataset.jsonl\", \"w\") as f:\n",
    "    for item in dataset:\n",
    "        f.write(json.dumps(item) + \"\\n\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Result:** 100 realistic customer questions with expected answers\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 3: Test Candidate Models\n",
    "\n",
    "**Run each model on the test dataset:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Test GPT-4o-mini\n",
    "results_mini = []\n",
    "for item in test_dataset:\n",
    "    response = model_mini.query(item[\"query\"])\n",
    "    results_mini.append({\n",
    "        \"query\": item[\"query\"],\n",
    "        \"response\": response,\n",
    "        \"expected\": item[\"response\"]\n",
    "    })\n",
    "\n",
    "# Test GPT-4o\n",
    "results_4o = []\n",
    "for item in test_dataset:\n",
    "    response = model_4o.query(item[\"query\"])\n",
    "    results_4o.append({\n",
    "        \"query\": item[\"query\"],\n",
    "        \"response\": response,\n",
    "        \"expected\": item[\"response\"]\n",
    "    })\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 4: Evaluate Results\n",
    "\n",
    "**Use evaluation metrics:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from azure.ai.evaluation import evaluate\n",
    "\n",
    "# Evaluate GPT-4o-mini\n",
    "eval_mini = evaluate(\n",
    "    data=results_mini,\n",
    "    evaluators={\n",
    "        \"groundedness\": groundedness_evaluator,\n",
    "        \"relevance\": relevance_evaluator,\n",
    "        \"coherence\": coherence_evaluator\n",
    "    }\n",
    ")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Evaluate GPT-4o\n",
    "eval_4o = evaluate(\n",
    "    data=results_4o,\n",
    "    evaluators={...}\n",
    ")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 5: Compare and Decide\n",
    "\n",
    "**Create comparison:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "comparison = {\n",
    "    \"GPT-4o-mini\": {\n",
    "        \"quality\": eval_mini.average_scores,\n",
    "        \"cost\": 0.50,\n",
    "        \"latency\": 800\n",
    "    },\n",
    "    \"GPT-4o\": {\n",
    "        \"quality\": eval_4o.average_scores,\n",
    "        \"cost\": 2.50,\n",
    "        \"latency\": 1200\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Decision framework:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "If quality_difference < 0.3 AND cost_difference > 2x:\n",
    "    → Choose cheaper model (GPT-4o-mini)\n",
    "    \n",
    "If quality_difference > 0.5:\n",
    "    → Choose better model (GPT-4o)\n",
    "    \n",
    "Else:\n",
    "    → Consider hybrid approach\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 6: Iterate\n",
    "\n",
    "- Test with more data points\n",
    "- Try different prompts\n",
    "- Consider fine-tuning\n",
    "- Re-evaluate periodically"

    "## Best Practices\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Generate Diverse Test Cases\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Good - covers different intents\n",
    "queries = [\n",
    "    \"What paint is best for exterior wood?\",      # Recommendation\n",
    "    \"Is SKU PFIP000002 in stock?\",                # Fact check\n",
    "    \"Compare latex vs oil-based paint\",           # Comparison\n",
    "    \"I need eco-friendly options\",                # Filtered search\n",
    "    \"What's the price of Premium Exterior Paint?\" # Specific fact\n",
    "]\n",
    "\n",
    "# Less effective - repetitive\n",
    "queries = [\n",
    "    \"What paint do you have?\",\n",
    "    \"Do you sell paint?\",\n",
    "    \"Tell me about paint\",\n",
    "    # All similar intent\n",
    "]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Use Realistic Phrasings\n",
    "\n",
    "Generate queries that match how real customers talk:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Realistic\n",
    "\"I'm painting my deck, what should I use?\"\n",
    "\"Need something for outdoor wood\"\n",
    "\"Best paint for weather resistance?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# Too formal (less realistic)\n",
    "\"Please provide recommendations for exterior wood coating solutions\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Include Edge Cases\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Test edge cases\n",
    "\"Do you have paint?\" # Vague\n",
    "\"I need PFIP000002 but in blue\" # Specific constraint\n",
    "\"What's the cheapest paint?\" # Price-focused\n",
    "\"\" # Empty query\n",
    "\"ajshdkajhsd\" # Gibberish\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Balance Dataset Size\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Too small** (< 20 queries): Not representative\n",
    "- **Good** (50-100 queries): Balanced coverage\n",
    "- **Large** (500+ queries): Comprehensive, but slower/costlier to run\n",
    "\n",
    "**Start with 50-100, expand if needed**\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Version Your Datasets\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Save with version numbers\n",
    "\"test_dataset_v1.jsonl\"  # Initial\n",
    "\"test_dataset_v2.jsonl\"  # Added edge cases\n",
    "\"test_dataset_v3.jsonl\"  # Added multi-turn conversations\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
