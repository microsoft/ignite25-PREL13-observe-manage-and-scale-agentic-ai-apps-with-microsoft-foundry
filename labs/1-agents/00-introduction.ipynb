    "## What is an AI Agent?\n",
    "\n",
    "An **AI agent** is an autonomous system that uses large language models (LLMs) to understand goals, make decisions, invoke tools, and complete tasks with minimal human intervention.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The key difference:**\n",
    "- **AI Assistant**: Supports human interactions, answers questions, provides information\n",
    "- **AI Agent**: Takes autonomous actions, invokes tools, participates in workflows to reach goals\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**: When a customer asks Cora \"What paint do you have?\", the agent:\n",
    "1. Understands the question (using the language model)\n",
    "2. Decides which tools to call (product search, inventory check)\n",
    "3. Retrieves information (calls tools autonomously)\n",
    "4. Generates a helpful response (synthesizes results)\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of an agent as an assistant that can actually *do things*, not just talk about them.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key characteristics of agents:**\n",
    "- **Autonomy**: Makes decisions independently within defined constraints\n",
    "- **Tool Use**: Can call functions, APIs, search databases, etc.\n",
    "- **Reasoning**: Uses LLM capabilities to plan and problem-solve\n",
    "- **Goal-Oriented**: Works toward completing specific objectives"

    "## The Three Core Components of an AI Agent\n",
    "\n",
    "Every AI agent is built from three essential components:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Model (LLM)\n",
    "\n",
    "The **model** provides language understanding and reasoning capabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What it does:**\n",
    "- Understands natural language inputs\n",
    "- Generates human-like responses\n",
    "- Reasons about which tools to use\n",
    "- Synthesizes information from multiple sources\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example models:**\n",
    "- `gpt-4o` - Advanced reasoning, multimodal capabilities\n",
    "- `gpt-4o-mini` - Fast, efficient, cost-effective\n",
    "- `gpt-4.1` - Strong general-purpose performance\n",
    "\n",
    "**Choosing a model:**\n",
    "- **Complex reasoning**: Use `gpt-4o` or `gpt-4.1`\n",
    "- **High volume, speed matters**: Use `gpt-4o-mini`\n",
    "- **Multimodal needs** (images, audio): Use `gpt-4o`\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "**Instructions** define the agent's personality, behavior, constraints, and goals.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What they include:**\n",
    "- Role and personality (e.g., \"You are a helpful hardware store assistant\")\n",
    "- Response style (e.g., \"Be polite and professional\")\n",
    "- Constraints (e.g., \"Only provide factual product information\")\n",
    "- Guidelines (e.g., \"If you don't know, say so - don't make things up\")\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example for Cora:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "instructions = \"\"\"\n",
    "You are Cora, a helpful customer service assistant for Zava Hardware Store.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your role:\n",
    "- Answer customer questions about products politely and accurately\n",
    "- Help customers find the right products for their home improvement needs\n",
    "- Provide SKU, price, and inventory information when asked\n",
    "- Never make up product information - only use the tools provided\n",
    "\n",
    "Your tone:\n",
    "- Friendly and professional\n",
    "- Patient and helpful\n",
    "- Clear and concise\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Good instructions make the difference between a generic chatbot and a specialized assistant.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Tools\n",
    "\n",
    "**Tools** extend the agent's capabilities beyond language understanding, allowing it to take actions and retrieve information.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Common tool types:**\n",
    "- **Function calling**: Execute custom Python functions\n",
    "- **File search**: Search through uploaded documents\n",
    "- **Code interpreter**: Run Python code dynamically\n",
    "- **API calls**: Access external systems and databases\n",
    "- **Knowledge bases**: Query vector databases, Azure AI Search\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example tools for Cora:**\n",
    "- `get_product_info(sku)` - Retrieve product details\n",
    "- `check_inventory(sku)` - Get current stock levels\n",
    "- `search_products(query)` - Find products matching criteria\n",
    "- `calculate_discount(customer_tier, cart_value)` - Compute personalized pricing\n",
    "\n",
    "**How tools work:**\n",
    "1. Agent receives customer question\n",
    "2. Model reasons about which tool to use\n",
    "3. Agent calls the tool with appropriate parameters\n",
    "4. Tool returns results\n",
    "5. Agent uses results to formulate response\n",
    "\n",
    "Tools transform agents from conversationalists into action-takers."

    "\n",
    "Understanding these concepts is essential for working with agents in Azure AI Foundry.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Thread\n",
    "\n",
    "A **thread** represents a single conversation session between a user and an agent.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Think of it as:** A chat window or conversation history.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What it contains:**\n",
    "- All messages exchanged between user and agent\n",
    "- Context that persists across multiple turns\n",
    "- Metadata about the conversation\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Create a new thread (new conversation)\n",
    "thread = client.agents.create_thread()\n",
    "\n",
    "# Later, use the same thread to continue the conversation\n",
    "thread_id = thread.id\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Use cases:**\n",
    "- One thread per customer support session\n",
    "- One thread per user in a multi-turn application\n",
    "- Separate threads for different topics/conversations\n",
    "\n",
    "### Message\n",
    "\n",
    "A **message** is a single exchange within a thread - either from the user or the agent.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Message types:**\n",
    "- **User messages**: Questions or requests from the customer\n",
    "- **Assistant messages**: Responses generated by the agent\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# User sends a message\n",
    "message = client.agents.create_message(\n",
    "    thread_id=thread.id,\n",
    "    role=\"user\",\n",
    "    content=\"What paint do you have for exterior wood?\"\n",

    "\n",
    "# Agent responds (created during Run)\n",
    "# Assistant message is automatically added to thread\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important**: Messages are stored in chronological order, maintaining conversation context.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Run\n",
    "\n",
    "A **run** is the processing cycle where the agent:\n",
    "1. Reads the latest user message\n",
    "2. Reasons about how to respond\n",
    "3. Calls tools if needed\n",
    "4. Generates a response\n",
    "5. Adds the response to the thread\n",
    "\n",
    "**Think of it as:** The agent \"thinking\" and taking action.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Start a run (agent processes the thread)\n",
    "run = client.agents.create_run(\n",
    "    thread_id=thread.id,\n",
    "    assistant_id=assistant.id\n",
    ")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Wait for run to complete\n",
    "while run.status in [\"queued\", \"in_progress\"]:\n",
    "    run = client.agents.get_run(thread_id=thread.id, run_id=run.id)\n",
    "    time.sleep(1)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Run completed - agent's response is now in the thread\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Run statuses:**\n",
    "- `queued` - Waiting to start\n",
    "- `in_progress` - Agent is processing\n",
    "- `requires_action` - Needs tool approval (if required)\n",
    "- `completed` - Finished successfully\n",
    "- `failed` - Encountered an error\n",
    "\n",
    "### How They Work Together\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "1. Create Thread\n",
    "   ↓\n",
    "2. User adds Message to Thread\n",

    "\n",
    "### Use Simple Prompting When:\n",
    "\n",
    "- ✅ Task is straightforward (classification, summarization, Q&A)\n",
    "- ✅ No external data needed (all context in prompt)\n",
    "- ✅ No actions required (just generate text)\n",
    "- ✅ Low latency critical (single API call)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:** \"Summarize this product description in 2 sentences\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### Use Agents When:\n",
    "\n",
    "- ✅ Need to retrieve external information (databases, APIs, search)\n",
    "- ✅ Multi-step reasoning required (plan → execute → verify)\n",
    "- ✅ Need to take actions (update records, send emails, make purchases)\n",
    "- ✅ Complex workflows (if this, then that logic)\n",
    "- ✅ Maintain conversation context across turns\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:** \"Find me the best paint for my outdoor deck, check if it's in stock, and calculate my discount\"\n",

    "### Hybrid Approach:\n",
    "\n",
    "Start simple, add complexity as needed:\n",

    "## Best Practices for Building Agents\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Write Clear Instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Good - specific and actionable\n",
    "instructions = \"\"\"\n",
    "You are Cora, a Zava Hardware Store assistant.\n",
    "When customers ask about products:\n",
    "1. Use get_product_info to retrieve accurate details\n",
    "2. Always include SKU, price, and description\n",
    "3. If out of stock, suggest alternatives\n",
    "4. Never fabricate information\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# Less effective - vague\n",
    "instructions = \"You are a helpful assistant. Be nice.\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Choose Tools Wisely\n",
    "\n",
    "**Too few tools:** Agent can't complete tasks\n",
    "**Too many tools:** Agent gets confused about which to use\n",
    "\n",
    "**Guideline:** Start with 3-5 essential tools, add more as needed\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Test Tool Descriptions\n",
    "\n",
    "Tools have descriptions that help the agent decide when to use them:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Good - clear when to use\n",
    "{\n",
    "    \"name\": \"get_product_info\",\n",
    "    \"description\": \"Retrieve product details by SKU. Use when customer asks about specific products, prices, or features.\"\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "# Unclear\n",
    "{\n",
    "    \"name\": \"get_product_info\", \n",
    "    \"description\": \"Gets product data\"\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Handle Failures Gracefully\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# In instructions:\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "If a tool call fails:\n",
    "1. Apologize to the customer\n",
    "2. Explain what went wrong simply\n",
    "3. Offer alternatives if possible\n",
    "4. Never expose technical error details\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Monitor and Iterate\n",
    "\n",
    "- Track which tools are used most frequently\n",
    "- Identify common failure patterns\n",
    "- Review conversation logs for improvement opportunities\n",
    "- Use evaluation metrics to measure quality"
