    "\n",
    "## 🛒 The Zava Scenario\n",
    "\n",
    "Cora has been evaluated, tested, and is ready for customers. But deploying an AI agent to production is different from deploying traditional applications. How do we ensure Cora can handle production traffic? What about managing costs and updates?\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Reality**: Production deployment requires careful planning around capacity management, monitoring, rollout strategies, and operational readiness.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What You'll Learn\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, you'll understand:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Model deployment fundamentals** - From development to production\n",
    "2. **Capacity planning** - PTUs vs. pay-per-use pricing models\n",
    "3. **Deployment strategies** - Blue-green and canary deployments\n",
    "4. **Monitoring and observability** - Tracking performance in production\n",
    "5. **Production readiness checklist** - Key considerations before launch\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why This Matters\n",
    "\n",
    "Successful deployment ensures:\n",
    "- **Reliability** - Cora is available when customers need it\n",
    "- **Performance** - Fast response times even under load\n",
    "- **Cost optimization** - Right-sized infrastructure for your needs\n",
    "- **Safe updates** - Rolling out improvements without disruption\n",

    "## What is Model Deployment?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Model deployment** is the process of making your AI model available for production use.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Development vs. Production\n",
    "\n",
    "**Development environment:**\n",
    "- Test models locally or in notebooks\n",
    "- Experiment with different configurations\n",
    "- Limited users (just you and your team)\n",
    "- Failures are acceptable (learning process)\n",
    "- Can restart/change anytime\n",
    "\n",
    "**Production environment:**\n",
    "- Model serves real customers\n",
    "- Must be reliable and performant\n",
    "- High availability required\n",
    "- Failures impact business\n",
    "- Changes must be carefully managed\n",
    "\n",
    "**Deployment bridges this gap.**\n",
    "\n",
    "### What Gets Deployed\n",
    "\n",
    "**For base models:**\n",
    "- Model already deployed by Azure\n",
    "- You just reference it (e.g., \"gpt-4o-mini\")\n",
    "- No deployment action needed\n",
    "\n",
    "**For fine-tuned models:**\n",
    "- Custom model created by your fine-tuning job\n",
    "- Exists in Azure but not yet accessible\n",
    "- Must be **deployed** to make it available via API\n",
    "- Gets a deployment name you can reference\n",
    "\n",
    "**Analogy:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "Fine-tuning = Building a custom car\n",
    "Deployment = Putting it on the road for use\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Deployment Process\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "1. Fine-Tuning Job Completes\n",
    "   ↓\n",
    "   Model created (fine-tuned-model-xyz)\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. Create Deployment\n",
    "   ↓\n",
    "   Deploy model to inference endpoint\n",
    "   Assign capacity (tokens per minute)\n",
    "   Name deployment (e.g., \"cora-v1\")\n",
    "   \n",
    "3. Deployment Ready\n",

    "## Deployment Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "### Deployment Name\n",
    "\n",
    "**What it is:** A friendly name for your deployed model\n",
    "\n",
    "**Purpose:**\n",
    "- Reference model in API calls\n",
    "- Distinguish between versions\n",
    "- Organize multiple deployments\n",
    "\n",
    "**Examples:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Good deployment names\n",
    "\"cora-fine-tuned-v1\"\n",
    "\"zava-customer-service-prod\"\n",
    "\"product-assistant-2024-11\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# Less clear\n",
    "\"my-model\"\n",
    "\"test\"\n",
    "\"deployment1\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Best practice:** Use descriptive, versioned names\n",
    "\n",
    "### Model ID vs. Deployment Name\n",
    "\n",
    "**Model ID:**\n",
    "- Created by fine-tuning job\n",
    "- Immutable (doesn't change)\n",
    "- Example: `ft:gpt-4o-mini:zava:abc123::xyz789`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Deployment Name:**\n",
    "- Chosen by you when deploying\n",
    "- Mutable (can redeploy)\n",
    "- Example: `cora-v1`\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Deploy model (one-time)\n",
    "create_deployment(\n",
    "    model=model_id,              # What to deploy\n",
    "    name=deployment_name         # What to call it\n",
    ")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Use model (many times)\n",

    "    model=deployment_name,       # Use friendly name\n",
    "    prompt=customer_question\n",
    ")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Capacity and Scaling\n",
    "\n",
    "**Capacity = Tokens Per Minute (TPM)**\n",
    "\n",
    "**What it means:**\n",
    "- Maximum tokens your deployment can process per minute\n",
    "- Includes input + output tokens\n",
    "- Determines throughput\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "Deployment capacity: 10,000 TPM\n",
    "\n",
    "Customer query: 100 tokens\n",
    "Typical response: 150 tokens\n",
    "Total per request: 250 tokens\n",
    "\n",
    "Max queries/minute: 10,000 / 250 = 40 queries\n",
    "Max queries/day: 40 × 60 × 24 = 57,600 queries\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Choosing capacity:**\n",
    "\n",
    "| Use Case | Recommended TPM | Reasoning |\n",
    "|----------|-----------------|-----------|\n",
    "| **Development/Testing** | 1,000 - 10,000 | Low volume, cost-effective |\n",
    "| **Small Production** | 10,000 - 50,000 | Hundreds of users |\n",
    "| **Medium Production** | 50,000 - 200,000 | Thousands of users |\n",
    "| **Large Production** | 200,000+ | High volume, enterprise scale |\n",
    "\n",
    "**Scaling strategies:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Start small\n",
    "initial_capacity = 10_000  # TPM\n",
    "\n",
    "# Monitor usage\n",
    "actual_usage = get_usage_metrics()\n",
    "\n",
    "# Scale up if needed\n",
    "if actual_usage > 0.8 * initial_capacity:\n",
    "    new_capacity = initial_capacity * 2\n",
    "    update_deployment(capacity=new_capacity)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Deployment Region\n",
    "\n",
    "**Considerations:**\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Latency**\n",
    "- Deploy close to users\n",
    "- Reduces response time\n",
    "- Better user experience\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Model Availability**\n",
    "- Not all models in all regions\n",
    "- Fine-tuning available in specific regions\n",
    "- Check availability before deploying\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Compliance**\n",
    "- Data residency requirements\n",
    "- Regional regulations\n",
    "- Company policies\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example regions:**\n",
    "- East US\n",
    "- West Europe\n",
    "- Sweden Central (popular for fine-tuning)\n",
    "- North Central US\n",
    "\n",
    "**Best practice:** Deploy in same region as your fine-tuning job"

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Possible statuses:**\n",
    "- `succeeded` → Ready to deploy ✓\n",
    "- `running` → Wait for completion\n",
    "- `failed` → Check errors, retry\n",
    "- `cancelled` → Start new job\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 2: Create Deployment\n",
    "\n",
    "**Using Azure OpenAI SDK:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from azure.ai.ml import MLClient\n",

    "6. Click \"Deploy\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 3: Verify Deployment\n",
    "\n",
    "**Test the deployed model:**\n",

    "# → Should respond in Cora's fine-tuned style\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Verification checklist:**\n",
    "- ✓ Model responds without errors\n",
    "- ✓ Response quality matches expectations\n",
    "- ✓ Latency is acceptable (< 2-3 seconds)\n",
    "- ✓ Style matches fine-tuned behavior\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 4: Update Application\n",
    "\n",
    "**Point your application to the new deployment:**\n",
    "\n",

    "## Model Management Best Practices\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Version Your Deployments\n",
    "\n",
    "**Use semantic versioning:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Version naming\n",
    "\"cora-v1.0\"  # Initial release\n",
    "\"cora-v1.1\"  # Minor update (bug fix)\n",
    "\"cora-v2.0\"  # Major update (new capabilities)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Date-based versioning\n",
    "\"cora-2024-11-13\"\n",
    "\"cora-november-prod\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# Environment-based\n",
    "\"cora-dev\"\n",
    "\"cora-staging\"\n",
    "\"cora-prod\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Benefits:**\n",
    "- Clear version history\n",
    "- Easy rollback if needed\n",
    "- A/B testing between versions\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Maintain Multiple Deployments\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "deployments = {\n",
    "    \"cora-prod\": {\n",
    "        \"model\": \"ft:gpt-4o-mini:zava:v1\",\n",
    "        \"capacity\": 50_000,\n",
    "        \"purpose\": \"Production traffic\"\n",
    "    },\n",
    "    \"cora-staging\": {\n",
    "        \"model\": \"ft:gpt-4o-mini:zava:v2\",\n",
    "        \"capacity\": 10_000,\n",

    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Workflow:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "1. Develop → test in cora-dev\n",
    "2. Validate → promote to cora-staging\n",
    "3. Production test → small % to cora-staging\n",
    "4. Full rollout → switch cora-prod\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Implement Rollback Strategy\n",
    "\n",
    "**Quick rollback if issues occur:**\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "# If v2.0 has issues\n",
    "def rollback():\n",
    "    \"\"\"Switch back to previous version\"\"\"\n",
    "    deployments[\"current\"] = deployments[\"previous\"]\n",
    "    print(f\"Rolled back to {deployments['current']}\")\n",

    "# Monitor for issues\n",
    "if error_rate > threshold:\n",
    "    rollback()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Keep previous versions deployed for quick switching.**\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Monitor Deployment Health\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key metrics to track:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Usage metrics\n",
    "total_requests = count_api_calls()\n",
    "tokens_used = sum_token_usage()\n",

    "p95_latency = percentile_95_response_time()\n",
    "\n",
    "# Cost metrics\n",
    "daily_cost = tokens_used * price_per_token\n",
    "\n",
    "# Quality metrics\n",
    "satisfaction_score = average_user_rating()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Set up alerts:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "alerts = {\n",
    "    \"error_rate\": {\"threshold\": 0.05, \"action\": \"page_on_call\"},\n",

    "### 5. Document Deployments\n",
    "\n",
    "**Maintain deployment registry:**\n",

    "## Deployment Strategies\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Blue-Green Deployment\n",
    "\n",
    "**Maintain two identical environments:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Blue (current production):\n",
    "- Deployment: cora-blue\n",
    "- Handles 100% traffic\n",
    "- Known stable version\n",
    "\n",
    "Green (new version):\n",
    "- Deployment: cora-green  \n",
    "- Handles 0% traffic initially\n",
    "- New version being validated\n",
    "\n",
    "Cutover:\n",
    "1. Deploy new version to Green\n",
    "2. Test Green thoroughly\n",
    "3. Switch traffic: Blue → Green\n",
    "4. Keep Blue as rollback option\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Benefits:**\n",
    "- Zero-downtime deployment\n",
    "- Instant rollback (switch back to Blue)\n",
    "- Full testing before production traffic\n",
    "\n",
    "**Implementation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Traffic router\n",
    "def route_traffic(use_green=False):\n",
    "    if use_green:\n",
    "        return \"cora-green\"\n",
    "    else:\n",
    "        return \"cora-blue\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# Gradual cutover\n",
    "MODEL = route_traffic(use_green=True)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Canary Deployment\n",
    "\n",
    "**Gradually roll out to small % of users:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Phase 1: 5% traffic to new version\n",
    "  → Monitor for 24 hours\n",
    "  → Check metrics\n",
    "  \n",
    "Phase 2: 25% traffic to new version\n",
    "  → Monitor for 24 hours\n",
    "  → Check metrics\n",
    "  \n",
    "Phase 3: 50% traffic to new version\n",
    "  → Monitor for 24 hours\n",
    "  → Check metrics\n",
    "  \n",
    "Phase 4: 100% traffic to new version\n",
    "  → Full rollout complete\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Implementation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import random\n",
    "\n",
    "def get_deployment():\n",
    "    \"\"\"Route traffic based on rollout percentage\"\"\"\n",
    "    rollout_percentage = 0.25  # 25% to new version\n",

    "**Benefits:**\n",
    "- Limit blast radius of issues\n",
    "- Real-world validation\n",
    "- Easy rollback (reduce percentage)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. A/B Testing\n",
    "\n",
    "**Compare two versions with real users:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def assign_model(user_id):\n",

    "analyze_ab_test(metrics)\n",
    "# → If v2.0 is better, roll out to everyone\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
