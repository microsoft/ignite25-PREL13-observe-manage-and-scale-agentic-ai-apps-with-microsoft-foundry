    "\n",
    "## 🛒 The Zava Scenario\n",
    "\n",
    "Cora is now responding to customer queries about home improvement products, but how do we know if the responses are good? Are they accurate, relevant, and safe? Before deploying Cora to production, Zava needs objective metrics to measure quality and safety.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Challenge**: Evaluating AI systems requires more than manual spot-checking. We need systematic, repeatable methods to assess response quality, ensure factual accuracy, and detect potential safety issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What You'll Learn\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, you'll understand:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **GenAIOps** - The complete lifecycle of generative AI operations\n",
    "2. **Quality metrics** - Groundedness, relevance, coherence, and fluency\n",
    "3. **Safety metrics** - Detecting harmful content and jailbreak attempts\n",
    "4. **How to use Azure AI Evaluation SDK** to run evaluations\n",
    "5. **Interpreting evaluation results** to improve your agent\n",

    "## Why This Matters\n",

    "Rigorous evaluation helps you:\n",
    "- **Build confidence** before production deployment\n",
    "- **Compare models objectively** using standardized metrics\n",
    "- **Identify issues early** before customers encounter them\n",
    "- **Continuously improve** by tracking metrics over time\n",

    "## Why AI Evaluation Matters\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Challenge:** How do you know if your AI application is good enough for production?\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Risk of Skipping Evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "**Without evaluation:**\n",
    "- ❌ **Hallucinations** - Cora invents product information\n",
    "- ❌ **Irrelevant responses** - Answers don't address customer questions\n",
    "- ❌ **Unsafe content** - Generates harmful or biased responses\n",
    "- ❌ **Inconsistent quality** - Sometimes great, sometimes terrible\n",
    "- ❌ **No improvement path** - Can't measure if changes help\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example failure:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "Customer: \"Is SKU PFIP000002 in stock?\"\n",
    "Cora (hallucinating): \"Yes! We have 150 units available at $39.99\"\n",
    "Reality: Out of stock, costs $45.99\n",
    "\n",
    "Result: Customer frustration, lost trust, potential legal issues\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Value of Evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "**With systematic evaluation:**\n",
    "- ✅ **Quantify quality** - \"Accuracy is 92%, up from 85% last week\"\n",
    "- ✅ **Catch issues early** - Find problems before customers do\n",
    "- ✅ **Compare approaches** - \"Model A is 15% better than Model B\"\n",
    "- ✅ **Track improvements** - \"Fine-tuning increased relevance by 20%\"\n",
    "- ✅ **Build confidence** - Know your system is ready for production\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example success:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "Evaluation shows:\n",
    "- Groundedness: 4.8/5 (responses based on facts)\n",
    "- Relevance: 4.6/5 (addresses customer questions)\n",
    "- Safety: 5/5 (no harmful content)\n",
    "\n",
    "Conclusion: Ready for production deployment\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Evaluation vs. Testing\n",
    "\n",
    "**Traditional software testing:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "Input: \"2 + 2\"\n",
    "Expected output: \"4\"\n",
    "Test: Does output == \"4\"? → Pass/Fail\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**AI evaluation:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "Input: \"What paint is best for kitchens?\"\n",
    "Expected: Helpful, accurate, relevant response\n",
    "Evaluation: How good is the response? → Score 0-5\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key differences:**\n",
    "- Software: Binary (pass/fail)\n",
    "- AI: Continuous (scored on scale)\n",
    "- Software: Deterministic (same output every time)\n",
    "- AI: Non-deterministic (outputs vary)\n",
    "\n",
    "**This is why we need specialized evaluation methods for AI.**"

    "\n",
    "**1. Quality Evaluators**\n",

    "- **Coherence** - Logically structured?\n",
    "- **Fluency** - Natural language?\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Safety Evaluators**\n",
    "Measure content safety:\n",
    "- **Hate/Unfairness** - Biased or discriminatory?\n",
    "- **Violence** - Promotes harm?\n",
    "- **Sexual Content** - Inappropriate content?\n",
    "- **Self-Harm** - Dangerous recommendations?\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Custom Evaluators**\n",
    "Measure domain-specific requirements:\n",
    "- **Brand Voice** - Matches company tone?\n",
    "- **Factual Accuracy** - Correct product info?\n",
    "- **Compliance** - Meets regulatory requirements?\n",

    "\n",
    "**Process:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "1. Evaluator receives inputs:\n",
    "   - Query: \"What paint do you have?\"\n",
    "   - Response: \"We have Premium Exterior Paint...\"\n",
    "   - Context: [retrieved product information]\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Evaluator analyzes response:\n",
    "   - Uses rules, patterns, or AI models\n",
    "   - Compares response to expectations\n",
    "   \n",
    "3. Evaluator returns score:\n",
    "   - Numeric score (e.g., 0-5 or 0-1)\n",
    "   - Reasoning (why this score)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example: Groundedness Evaluator**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def groundedness_evaluator(query, response, context):\n",
    "    \"\"\"Check if response is grounded in context\"\"\"\n",
    "    \n",
    "    # Extract claims from response\n",
    "    claims = extract_claims(response)\n",
    "    \n",
    "    # Verify each claim against context\n",
    "    grounded_claims = 0\n",
    "    for claim in claims:\n",
    "        if verify_claim_in_context(claim, context):\n",
    "            grounded_claims += 1\n",
    "    \n",
    "    # Calculate score\n",
    "    score = grounded_claims / len(claims) if claims else 0\n",
    "    \n",
    "    return {\n",

    "## Best Practices\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Evaluate Early and Often\n",

    "    \"→ Evaluate (baseline)\",\n",
    "    \"Improve prompts\",\n",
    "    \"→ Evaluate (check if better)\",\n",
    "    \"Add RAG\",\n",
    "    \"→ Evaluate (validate improvement)\",\n",
    "    \"Fine-tune model\",\n",
    "    \"→ Evaluate (final validation)\"\n",
    "]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Benefit:** Catch issues early, validate each improvement\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Use Diverse Test Data\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Cover different scenarios\n",
    "test_data = [\n",
    "    # Simple queries\n",
    "    {\"query\": \"What paint?\", ...},\n",
    "    \n",
    "    # Complex queries\n",
    "    {\"query\": \"Compare latex vs oil for outdoor furniture\", ...},\n",
    "    \n",
    "    # Edge cases\n",
    "    {\"query\": \"\", ...},  # Empty\n",
    "    {\"query\": \"aksdjhaksj\", ...},  # Gibberish\n",
    "    \n",
    "    # Different intents\n",

    "    {\"query\": \"What's best for Y?\", ...},  # Recommendation\n",
    "]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Benefit:** Comprehensive quality assessment\n",

    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Benefit:** Holistic evaluation (quality + safety + custom)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Save Results for Comparison\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Version your evaluations\n",
    "result_v1 = evaluate(..., output_path=\"./results/v1.0\")\n",

    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Define before evaluating\n",
    "acceptance_criteria = {\n",
    "    \"groundedness\": 4.0,\n",

    "```python\n",
    "# Don't just look at averages\n",
    "failures = find_low_scores(result, threshold=3)\n",
    "\n",
