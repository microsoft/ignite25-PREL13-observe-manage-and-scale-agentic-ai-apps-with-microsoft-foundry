    "\n",
    "Welcome! This notebook will guide you through creating a custom grader and using model distillation to transfer knowledge from a large, expensive model to a smaller, faster, and more cost-effective one.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🛒 Our Zava Scenario\n",
    "\n",
    "**Cora** is a customer service chatbot for **Zava** - a fictitious retailer of home improvement goods for DIY enthusiasts. While our fine-tuned model provides excellent tone and style, it's using a large, expensive model (GPT-4) for a focused task. Model distillation allows us to transfer this specialized knowledge to a smaller model (GPT-4.1-nano) for better cost-efficiency and performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🎯 What You'll Build\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this notebook, you'll have:\n",
    "- ✅ Created a custom grader to evaluate response quality consistently\n",
    "- ✅ Established baseline \"gold standard\" responses for evaluation\n",
    "- ✅ Defined clear grading criteria for tone and style assessment\n",
    "- ✅ Used distillation to transfer knowledge to a smaller model\n",
    "- ✅ Measured performance improvements in cost and latency\n",
    "- ✅ Validated that the distilled model maintains quality standards\n",

    "\n",
    "- How to design custom evaluators for specific business criteria\n",

    "- How to measure and validate distillation effectiveness\n",
    "- When to use distillation vs. fine-tuning vs. prompt engineering\n",

    "Congratulations! You've successfully implemented **model distillation** using Azure AI Foundry's evaluation and fine-tuning capabilities. Here's what you accomplished:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🎯 Distillation Achievement\n",
    "\n",
    "**Teacher → Student Transfer**: Successfully distilled specialized Zava customer service knowledge from a large reasoning model (GPT-4) into a much smaller, faster model (GPT-4.1-nano) while maintaining quality standards.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🏆 Key Accomplishments\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **✅ Custom Grader Creation**: Built a reliable evaluator using AI-assisted evaluation (LLM-as-a-Judge) with business-specific criteria\n",
    "2. **✅ Baseline Establishment**: Curated gold standard responses from successful fine-tuning data\n",
    "3. **✅ Quality Measurement**: Validated grader effectiveness on baseline data\n",
    "4. **✅ Knowledge Transfer**: Used distillation to transfer specialized capabilities to smaller model\n",
    "5. **✅ Performance Optimization**: Achieved cost and latency improvements while preserving quality\n",
    "\n",
    "### 📊 Business Impact\n",
    "\n",
    "- **🤑 Cost Reduction**: Smaller models use fewer tokens per inference, significantly reducing operational costs\n",
    "- **🏎️ Performance Boost**: Faster response times improve customer experience and system throughput  \n",
    "- **🎯 Quality Maintained**: Custom grader ensures distilled model meets Zava's tone and style standards\n",
    "- **📈 Scalability**: Efficient model allows handling higher customer volumes\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🧠 Technical Innovation\n",
    "\n",
    "**No Manual Training Data**: Achieved distillation without creating training examples manually - just by defining evaluation criteria and letting AI systems handle the knowledge transfer process.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Automated Pipeline**: Combined Azure AI Evaluations and Fine-Tuning to create an automated distillation workflow.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Objective Measurement**: Used consistent grading criteria throughout the process to validate improvement.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
