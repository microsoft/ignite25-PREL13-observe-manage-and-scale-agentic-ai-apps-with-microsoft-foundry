    "# 🎯 | Cora-For-Zava: Advanced Model Distillation\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome! This notebook demonstrates how to use model distillation to transfer specialized knowledge from a large, expensive model to a smaller, faster, and more cost-effective one while maintaining quality standards.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🛒 Our Zava Scenario\n",
    "\n",
    "**Cora** is a customer service chatbot for **Zava** - a fictitious retailer of home improvement goods for DIY enthusiasts. You've fine-tuned a model for excellent tone and style, but it's using a large, expensive model (GPT-4) for a focused task. This notebook shows how to distill that specialized knowledge into a smaller model (GPT-4.1-nano) for optimal cost-efficiency and performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🎯 What You'll Build\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this notebook, you'll have:\n",
    "- ✅ Configured distillation pipeline using Azure AI evaluation and fine-tuning\n",
    "- ✅ Used your custom grader to measure baseline model performance  \n",
    "- ✅ Applied distillation techniques to transfer knowledge to a smaller model\n",
    "- ✅ Validated that the distilled model maintains quality standards\n",
    "- ✅ Measured performance improvements in cost, speed, and efficiency\n",
    "- ✅ Created a production-ready optimized model deployment\n",
    "\n",
    "## 💡 What You'll Learn\n",
    "\n",
    "- How to implement end-to-end model distillation workflows\n",
    "- How to use Azure AI Foundry's evaluation and fine-tuning services together\n",
    "- How to balance model capabilities with cost and performance requirements\n",
    "- How to validate distillation effectiveness using custom graders\n",
    "- How to measure and optimize model efficiency without sacrificing quality\n",
    "- When distillation provides the best ROI vs. other optimization approaches\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Key Concept**: Model distillation enables \"teaching\" smaller models to perform specialized tasks by learning from larger, more capable \"teacher\" models, achieving dramatic cost and performance improvements.\n",
