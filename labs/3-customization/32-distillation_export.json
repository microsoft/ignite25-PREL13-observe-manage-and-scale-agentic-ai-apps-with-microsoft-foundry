It must resemble the following:\n\n```\n{\n  \"steps\": [\n    { \n      \"description\": <one sentence describing your reasoning for Metric 1>\", \n      \"result\": <string representation of Metric 1's score> \n    },\n    { \n      \"description\": <one sentence describing your reasoning for Metric 2>\", \n      \"result\": <string representation of Metric 2's score> \n    }\n  ],\n  \"result\": <floating point value of the Final Score>\n}\n\n## General Guidance\nThe questions will be about paint products and related topics. Deep research is not required. Use common sense to determine if the answer is polite, helpful and factual.\n\n```\n",
