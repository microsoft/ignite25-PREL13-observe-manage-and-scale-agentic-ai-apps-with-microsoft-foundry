    "# 🎨 Introduction to Model Customization\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🛒 The Zava Scenario\n",
    "\n",
    "Cora is working well with a base model, but Zava wants it to provide responses that are more aligned with their brand voice, home improvement terminology, and customer service guidelines. Generic models may not capture the specific nuances of home improvement retail.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Opportunity**: Instead of relying solely on prompt engineering, we can customize the model itself through techniques like fine-tuning and distillation to make Cora more specialized for Zava's home improvement retail needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What You'll Learn\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, you'll understand:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Few-shot prompting** - Teaching models through examples in the prompt\n",
    "2. **Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT)** - Training models on domain-specific data\n",
    "3. **Distillation** - Transferring knowledge from larger to smaller models\n",
    "4. **Data preparation for fine-tuning** - JSONL format and best practices\n",
    "5. **When to use each customization technique** - Trade-offs and use cases\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why This Matters\n",
    "\n",
    "Model customization enables you to:\n",
    "- **Improve response quality** for domain-specific tasks\n",
    "- **Reduce costs** by using smaller, specialized models\n",
    "- **Align outputs** with brand voice and guidelines\n",
    "- **Handle specialized terminology** unique to your business\n",

    "## Why Customize Models?\n",
    "\n",
    "Base models (GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini) are trained on general internet data. They're powerful but generic.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Problems with base models:**\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Inconsistent Tone/Style\n",
    "\n",
    "**Customer:** \"What paint do you have?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**Base Model:** \"We have various paint options including interior, exterior, latex, oil-based...\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**Custom Model (Zava style):** \"Great question! We have several excellent paint options for your project. Let me help you find the perfect match...\"\n",
    "\n",
    "The custom model maintains Zava's friendly, helpful brand voice consistently.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Domain Knowledge Gaps\n",
    "\n",
    "**Customer:** \"I need paint for T1-11 siding\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**Base Model:** \"I can help you find paint. What color are you looking for?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**Custom Model:** \"For T1-11 siding, you'll want a high-quality exterior acrylic latex paint with good penetration. Our Premium Exterior Paint (PFIP000002) is perfect for this application...\"\n",
    "\n",
    "The custom model understands hardware/construction terminology.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Long Prompts\n",
    "\n",
    "**Without customization:** Need to include examples in every prompt\n",
    "```\n",
    "Prompt (500 tokens):\n",
    "\"You are Cora, a helpful Zava assistant. Examples:\n",
    "Q: What paint? A: [example]\n",
    "Q: What drill? A: [example]\n",
    "...\n",
    "Now answer: What paint do you have?\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**With customization:** Model \"knows\" the style already\n",
    "```\n",
    "Prompt (50 tokens):\n",
    "\"You are Cora. Customer asks: What paint do you have?\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Result:** Significant token reduction leads to lower costs at scale\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Response Consistency\n",
    "\n",
    "**Base model responses vary:**\n",
    "- Query 1: Formal and technical\n",
    "- Query 2: Casual and brief  \n",
    "- Query 3: Overly detailed\n",
    "\n",
    "**Custom model:** Consistent tone, structure, and detail level across all responses\n",
    "\n",
    "## Customization Approaches\n",
    "\n",
    "There are three main ways to customize model behavior:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Approach | What It Does | Best For | Cost | Effort |\n",
    "|----------|--------------|----------|------|--------|\n",
    "| **Few-Shot Prompting** | Include examples in prompt | Quick testing, dynamic examples | Low (pay per token) | Low |\n",
    "| **Fine-Tuning** | Train model on your data | Consistent style, domain knowledge | Medium (one-time training) | Medium |\n",
    "| **Distillation** | Transfer knowledge from larger model | Cost optimization, efficiency | Low-Medium | High |\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll explore each in detail."

    "## Few-Shot Prompting\n",
    "\n",
    "**Few-shot prompting** means including example query-response pairs in your prompt to guide the model's behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How It Works\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "prompt = \"\"\"\n",
    "You are Cora, a helpful Zava Hardware assistant.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example 1:\n",
    "Customer: What paint do you have?\n",
    "Cora: Great question! We have several excellent paint options. For interior \n",
    "projects, I recommend our Premium Interior Paint. For exterior, our Premium \n",
    "Exterior Paint is weather-resistant and durable. What's your project?\n",
    "\n",
    "Example 2:\n",
    "Customer: Is PFIP000002 in stock?\n",
    "Cora: Yes! Premium Exterior Paint (SKU: PFIP000002) is currently in stock \n",
    "with 75 units available. Would you like me to help you with anything else?\n",
    "\n",
    "Now answer:\n",

    "**The model learns from examples** and mimics the style.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Pros\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Quick to implement** - No training required  \n",
    "✅ **Flexible** - Change examples anytime  \n",
    "✅ **No infrastructure** - Just modify prompts  \n",
    "✅ **Dynamic** - Different examples for different scenarios\n",
    "\n",
    "### Cons\n",
    "\n",
    "❌ **Increases token costs** - Examples add 200-500 tokens per request  \n",
    "❌ **Uses context window** - Less room for actual conversation  \n",
    "❌ **Not as consistent** - Model still improvises  \n",
    "❌ **Limited examples** - Can only fit 5-10 examples\n",
    "\n",
    "### When to Use Few-Shot\n",
    "\n",
    "- ✅ Prototyping and testing\n",
    "- ✅ Need flexibility (examples change often)\n",
    "- ✅ Low query volume (< 1000/day)\n",
    "- ✅ Simple behavior changes\n",
    "- ❌ High query volume (expensive)\n",
    "- ❌ Need perfect consistency\n",
    "- ❌ Complex domain knowledge required\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example Calculation\n",
    "\n",
    "**Scenario:** 10,000 queries/day with 5 examples (300 tokens)\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Few-Shot Approach:\n",
    "- Higher token usage per request (examples included)\n",
    "- Pay-per-use model\n",
    "- Costs scale linearly with volume\n",
    "\n",
    "Fine-Tuning Approach:\n",
    "- Lower token usage per request (no examples needed)\n",
    "- One-time training cost\n",
    "- Lower per-request inference cost\n",
    "\n",
    "At high volumes, fine-tuning becomes more cost-effective.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Conclusion:** Few-shot works for low volume; fine-tuning better at scale.\n",

    "## Fine-Tuning\n",
    "\n",
    "**Fine-tuning** means continuing to train a base model on your specific data, adjusting its internal parameters to learn your domain and style.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How It Works\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Base Model (GPT-4o-mini)\n",
    "         ↓\n",

    "   (your-model-deployment)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**The model's weights are updated** to encode your patterns directly.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What Gets Trained\n",
    "\n",
    "**Training data format (JSONL):**\n",
    "\n",
    "```jsonl\n",
    "{\"messages\": [{\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": \"You are Cora, a Zava assistant\"}, {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"What paint do you have?\"}, {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"Great question! We have several excellent paint options...\"}]}\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Each line is a complete conversation example showing:\n",
    "1. System instructions\n",
    "2. User query\n",
    "3. Expected assistant response\n",
    "\n",
    "**The model learns:**\n",
    "- Response style and tone\n",
    "- Domain terminology\n",
    "- Response structure and format\n",
    "- Brand voice and personality\n",
    "\n",
    "### Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT)\n",
    "\n",
    "**SFT** is the most common fine-tuning approach:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Supervised** - You provide labeled examples (query → expected response)\n",
    "2. **Learning objective** - Model learns to predict your responses given inputs\n",
    "3. **Gradient descent** - Model weights adjusted to minimize error on your data\n",
    "\n",
    "**Analogy:** Like tutoring a student with practice problems and answer keys.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Preparing Training Data\n",
    "\n",
    "**Data requirements:**\n",
    "- **Minimum:** 50 examples (more is better)\n",
    "- **Recommended:** 100-1000 examples\n",
    "- **Format:** JSONL (JSON Lines)\n",
    "- **Quality:** High-quality examples only\n",
    "\n",
    "**Data sources:**\n",
    "1. **Real conversations** (if available)\n",
    "2. **Synthetic generation** (using Azure AI Simulator)\n",
    "3. **Manual curation** (expert-written examples)\n",
    "4. **Hybrid** (real + augmented)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example generation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "training_data = [\n",
    "    {\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Token Optimization\n",
    "\n",
    "**Problem:** Training cost based on token count\n",
    "\n",
    "**Formula:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "Training Cost = (Total Tokens in Dataset) × (Training Epochs) × (Price per Token)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Optimization strategies:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Remove redundancy**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Before (verbose)\n",
    "\"Hello! Thank you for asking! I'm happy to help you with that question...\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# After (concise)\n",
    "\"I recommend our Premium Exterior Paint for outdoor wood projects...\"\n",
    "```\n",

    "2. **Truncate long responses**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Keep responses under 150 tokens\n",
    "if token_count(response) > 150:\n",
    "    response = truncate_intelligently(response, 150)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Validate before uploading**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from azure.ai.ml import MLClient\n",
    "\n",
    "# Check token counts\n",
    "total_tokens = sum(count_tokens(ex) for ex in training_data)\n",
    "cost_estimate = (total_tokens * epochs * price_per_1k) / 1000\n",
    "\n",
    "print(f\"Estimated training cost: ${cost_estimate:.2f}\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",

    "1. **Prepare data** (JSONL format)\n",
    "2. **Upload to Azure OpenAI**\n",
    "3. **Submit fine-tuning job**\n",
    "4. **Monitor progress** (2-6 hours)\n",
    "5. **Deploy fine-tuned model**\n",
    "6. **Test and validate**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Azure OpenAI fine-tuning job:**\n",
    "\n",
