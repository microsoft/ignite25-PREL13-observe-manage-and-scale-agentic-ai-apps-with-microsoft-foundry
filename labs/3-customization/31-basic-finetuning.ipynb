    "# 🎯 | Cora-For-Zava: Model Customization with Fine-Tuning\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome! This notebook will guide you through customizing an AI model using Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) to improve tone, style, and response consistency for your specific use case.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🛒 Our Zava Scenario\n",
    "\n",
    "**Cora** is a customer service chatbot for **Zava** - a fictitious retailer of home improvement goods for DIY enthusiasts. While we've used few-shot examples and RAG to improve Cora's responses, these approaches increase prompt length (raising token costs and reducing available context window). Fine-tuning allows us to embed better tone and style directly into the model with shorter prompts.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🎯 What You'll Build\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this notebook, you'll have:\n",
    "- ✅ Prepared and validated training datasets for fine-tuning\n",
    "- ✅ Analyzed token usage to optimize training efficiency\n",
    "- ✅ Uploaded training data to Azure OpenAI for processing\n",
    "- ✅ Submitted and monitored a fine-tuning job\n",
    "- ✅ Deployed a custom fine-tuned model for testing\n",
    "- ✅ Evaluated the improved tone and style consistency\n",
    "\n",
    "## 💡 What You'll Learn\n",
    "\n",
    "- How to prepare JSONL datasets for supervised fine-tuning\n",
    "- How to validate token counts and optimize training data\n",
    "- How to submit and monitor fine-tuning jobs in Azure OpenAI\n",
    "- How to deploy and test fine-tuned models\n",
    "- How fine-tuning reduces prompt length while improving consistency\n",
    "- When to use fine-tuning vs. few-shot prompting vs. RAG\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Note**: Fine-tuning customizes model behavior at the foundation level, allowing shorter prompts while maintaining quality and consistency.\n",
