## Get Started

To get started, follow these steps:

1. **Fork The Repo**
   - Log into GitHub with your personal profile.
   - Fork the repo (main branch is sufficient)
   - You now have a sandbox to explore after the session
1. **Launch Codespaces**
   - Open your fork in the browser.
   - Click the `Code` button and select `Codespaces` tab
   - Click the `+` and create a new Codespace instance
1. **Wait For Terminal** 
   - a new browser tab opens with a VS Code editor
   - wait till the Codespace is ready & terminal is live
1. **Launch Instruction Guide**
   - type `mkdocs serve > /dev/null 2>&1 &` in terminal
   - this launches a preview server in background 
   - you will see a popup - select open browser 
   - OR go to Ports - select 8000 and open browser
