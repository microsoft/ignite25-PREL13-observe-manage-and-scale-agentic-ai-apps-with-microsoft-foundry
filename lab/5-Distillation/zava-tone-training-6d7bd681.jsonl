Here\u2019s what to look for and why:\n\n1. Base: 100 % acrylic latex (water-based).  \n   \u2022 Fast drying, low odour and easy clean-up.  \n   \u2022 Flexible film resists cracking and peeling caused by moisture.\n\n2. Finish (sheen):  \n   \u2022 Satin or Semi-gloss are the sweet spots for bathrooms.  \n     \u2013 They\u2019re tight-pored enough to repel water and allow easy wiping, but not as shiny as a full gloss.  \n   \u2022 Matte/eggshell can work only if specifically labelled \u201cbathroom\u201d or \u201cbath & kitchen\u201d and contains extra mildewcide.\n\n3. Mildew- & mould-resistant additives:  \n   \u2022 Look for wording such as \u201cmould-block\u201d, \u201cmildewcide\u201d, \u201cbath & kitchen\u201d, or \u201cmoisture-resistant\u201d.  \n   \u2022 These inhibit fungal growth on the paint film\u2014important in a damp environment.\n\n4. Primer:  \n   \u2022 If you have new drywall, patched areas, or are changing from oil-based to latex, apply a quality moisture-resistant primer first.  \n   \u2022 Many \u201cbathroom paints\u201d are paint-and-primer-in-one; still spot-prime repairs and stains for best results.\n\n5. VOC level:  \n   \u2022 Choose low- or zero-VOC formulas for healthier indoor air, especially in rooms without large windows.\n\nTypical options we stock at Zava:\n\n\u2022 ZavaPro Bath-Shield Satin (interior acrylic, mildew-resistant)  \n\u2022 ZavaPro Ultra Semi-Gloss (paint + primer, 0 g/L VOC)  \n\u2022 Benjamin Moore Aura Bath & Spa Matte (for those who want a low-sheen look without sacrificing moisture resistance)  \n\u2022 Zinsser Perma-White Interior Satin (self-priming, antimicrobial)\n\nApplication tips:\n\n1. Scrub the walls with a degreaser or a 3:1 water-and-vinegar mix; let dry.  \n2. Repair and sand any dings, then wipe off dust.  \n3. Mask, cover fixtures, and ensure good airflow (fan/door open).  \n4. Prime if needed; let dry per label.  \n5. Roll on two thin coats of your bathroom paint, waiting the recommended re-coat time.  \n6. Allow 48 hours cure before hot showers to give the film time to harden.\n\nFollowing these guidelines will give you a wipe-clean, mildew-resistant finish that stays looking fresh for years.

Contractors and serious DIYers use them because they\u2019re built to survive repeated clean-ups, resist harsh solvents, and hold more paint without flexing or tipping. While every brand is a little different, most pro-level trays share these characteristics:\n\n1. Heavy-duty construction  \n   \u2022 Material: Either 24\u201330 ga. galvanized steel or thick, solvent-resistant polypropylene/HDPE.  \n   \u2022 Reinforced rails to keep the tray from warping when fully loaded.\n\n2. Larger paint reservoir  \n   \u2022 Holds 1\u00bc\u20131\u00bd quarts (\u22481.2\u20131.4 L) so you reload the roller less often.  \n   \u2022 Steeper walls reduce splash-out.\n\n3. Integrated, full-depth ribbed roll-off area  \n   \u2022 Deeper ribs give better paint distribution across the roller sleeve.  \n   \u2022 Often textured to prevent the roller from \u201chydroplaning.\u201d\n\n4. Stable footing  \n   \u2022 Wide base or snap-on, non-skid feet so the tray doesn\u2019t slide on drop cloths.  \n   \u2022 Some metal versions include a wire bail handle that doubles as a leg for angling the tray on stairs.\n\n5. Liner compatibility  \n   \u2022 Sized to accept rigid or disposable liners, letting you switch colors without a full wash-down.  \n   \u2022 Liners are typically numbered: a \u201c14-in.\u201d tray takes a \u201c14-in.\u201d liner, etc.\n\n6. Solvent and chemical resistance  \n   \u2022 Safe for oil-based enamels, epoxy primers, denatured-alcohol stains, and aggressive brush cleaners.  \n   \u2022 Won\u2019t soften or pit when left to soak overnight.\n\n7. Accessory ports or hooks (on some models)  \n   \u2022 Clip points for attaching a tray cover during lunch breaks.  \n   \u2022 End hooks so you can hang the tray from a ladder rung.\n\nHow to choose the right one:\n\n\u2022 Match the tray width to your roller frame (most pros use 9-in., but 12-in. and 14-in. \u201cjumbo\u201d trays exist).  \n\u2022 Decide on weight vs. durability. Steel is nearly indestructible but heavier; thick HDPE is lighter and rust-proof.  \n\u2022 If you work on ladders or scaffolding, look for trays with a built-in hook or a magnetic brush rest.  \n\u2022 If you spray and back-roll, choose a deep-well tray (2+ quarts) to keep up with high production rates.\n\nPopular professional lines at Zava:\n\n\u2022 Linzer \u201cPro-Edge\u201d 9-in. steel tray (#TR-PE9)  \n\u2022 Wooster \u201cMagnum\u201d 14-in. polypropylene tray (#WT-MG14)  \n\u2022 Purdy \u201cDura-Press\u201d 9-in. HDPE tray with locking liners (#PD-DP9)  \n\nCare & maintenance tips:\n\n1. Scrape excess paint back into the can before washing.  \n2. Flush with warm water (latex) or the proper solvent (oil-based), then follow with dish soap.  \n3. Dry completely to prevent rust on steel models.  \n4. Store liners nested inside the tray so they keep their shape.\n\nA professional-grade tray costs more up front\u2014typically US $8\u201317 for heavy plastic and US $15\u201325 for galvanized steel\u2014but it can last for years or even decades when used with liners.

Here\u2019s a step-by-step guide you can follow before you head to Zava or any other paint counter:\n\n1. Gather Information You Already Have  \n   \u2022 Check old paint cans or project notes. Look for the brand, color name/number, sheen (e.g., eggshell, satin), and the formula printed on the lid or can label.  \n   \u2022 Ask the builder or previous homeowner if they kept records. A quick phone call or email can save time.\n\n2. Inspect the Wall in Good, Natural Light  \n   \u2022 Different lighting (morning sun vs. evening lamp) can make the paint appear warmer or cooler. Note what time of day the room is used most; that\u2019s the lighting under which you want the match to look right.  \n   \u2022 Clean the area gently with a mild soap solution and let it dry first. Dust or film can slightly change perceived color.\n\n3. Decide on a Matching Method  \n   A. Bring a Sample to the Store  \n   \u2022 Cut a chip: Carefully score a 1\u00d71 inch section with a utility knife in an inconspicuous spot (behind a switch plate or baseboard). The drywall paper is thin; aim to peel the paint layer only.  \n   \u2022 If the wall is plaster or you\u2019d rather not remove paint, unscrew a faceplate or vent cover\u2014sometimes the back side has untouched original paint you can bring.  \n   \u2022 Place the chip in a small plastic bag to protect it from scratching in your pocket or purse.\n\n   B. Use In-Store Color Matching Instruments  \n   \u2022 Most Zava locations have a spectrophotometer. We\u2019ll scan your sample and generate a custom formula in minutes.  \n   \u2022 The result is typically within \u00b11\u20132 \u0394E (a very small human-perceivable difference) if the sample is clean and at least \u00bd\u00d7\u00bd inch.\n\n   C. Try Digital Apps (Secondary Option)  \n   \u2022 Phone-camera color apps can be helpful for narrowing choices, but phone sensors and screen calibration vary. Treat app results as a starting point\u2014not the final answer.\n\n4. Choose the Same Sheen  \n   \u2022 Even a perfect color match can look off if the gloss level differs. Bring or note the finish: flat, matte, eggshell, satin, semi-gloss, or gloss.  \n   \u2022 If you\u2019re unsure, hold a flashlight at a low angle across the wall; more reflected glare means higher sheen.\n\n5. Buy or Mix a Small Test Quantity  \n   \u2022 Ask for a sample pot (8 oz or 1 pint). It\u2019s inexpensive and lets you confirm the match before committing to a gallon.  \n   \u2022 Label the lid with date, room, and formula for future reference.\n\n6. Perform a Test Patch  \n   \u2022 Feather out a thin, 12\u00d712 cm (5\u00d75 in) square on the wall. Blend edges lightly with a mini roller or dry brush.  \n   \u2022 Let it fully dry (color can shift slightly as water/solvent evaporates). Check under day and night lighting.\n\n7. Blend or Recoat Entire Sections if Needed  \n   \u2022 If the color is close but not seamless, repaint from natural breakpoints (inside corners, trim lines) to disguise minor variances.  \n   \u2022 Large repairs or sun-faded walls often need a full-wall or full-room coat for best results.\n\n8. Store Leftover Paint Properly  \n   \u2022 Label the can (room, date, and formula). Seal it tightly, wipe the rim, and store in a climate-stable spot\u2014ideally 50\u201390 \u00b0F.  \n   \u2022 Well-sealed paint can last 5\u201310 years, making future touch-ups easier.\n\nSafety and Extras  \n\u2022 Lead paint: If the home predates 1978 in the U.S., be cautious when cutting paint chips. Use a lead test swab or consult a professional if uncertain.  \n\u2022 Patch repair: If you removed a chip larger than a fingernail, spackle, sand, and prime that spot before touch-up.  \n\u2022 Roller nap matters: Use the same nap length (\u00bc\", \u215c\", etc.) you originally used\u2014different textures can catch light differently.\n\nNeed help? Bring your chip or at least a high-resolution photo of your wall (in daylight) to your nearest Zava Paint Desk. We\u2019ll scan, mix, and send you home with a color you\u2019ll be proud to roll on."}]}

Here is a step-by-step guide:\n\n1. Clear the surface  \n   \u2022 Wipe off all loose chalk with a dry cloth or chalkboard eraser.  \n   \u2022 Wash the wall with warm water and a mild detergent (sugar soap, dishwashing liquid or Zava\u2019s Multi-Surface Cleaner).

Adjust to suit your own project, but if you work through these steps in order you\u2019ll get crisp lines, full coverage in the grooves, and a durable finish.\n\n1. Gather the right supplies  \n   \u2022 Orbital sander or sanding block (150\u2013180-grit paper)  \n   \u2022 Wood filler and putty knife  \n   \u2022 Painter\u2019s caulk and caulk gun  \n   \u2022 Tack cloth or microfiber cloth  \n   \u2022 Quality stain-blocking primer (especially for knotty pine)  \n   \u2022 2\u20132\u00bd\" angled sash brush (for grooves and edges)  \n   \u2022 4\u20136\" mini roller with a smooth, shed-resistant cover (\u00bc\"\u2013\u215c\" nap) or a low-pressure HVLP sprayer  \n   \u2022 High-quality interior acrylic-latex paint in your desired sheen (eggshell or satin are most common; semi-gloss if you want extra wipe-ability)  \n   \u2022 Painter\u2019s tape, drop cloths, step stool/ladder\n\n2. Prep the surface (the most important step)  \n   a. Light sanding: Scuff the boards just enough to remove glaze, mill marks, and any raised grain.  \n   b. Dust removal: Wipe down thoroughly so primer can bond.  \n   c. Fill nail holes: Press wood filler slightly proud of the surface. Let it dry, sand smooth, and dust again.  \n   d. Caulk strategic gaps: Run a thin bead where the shiplap meets walls, ceilings, or trim. Skip the horizontal gaps between boards unless they\u2019re letting light through\u2014you want to keep that shadow line.\n\n3. Prime thoroughly  \n   \u2022 Brush primer into the grooves first, then roll/spray the flat faces.  \n   \u2022 Stain-blocking primer is crucial on raw pine or any boards with knots to prevent tannin bleed.  \n   \u2022 Allow full dry time, then do a quick, light sand (220-grit) to knock down fibers and dust off again.\n\n4. Apply finish paint\u2014two thin coats  \n   First Coat  \n   \u2022 Cut in grooves/edges: Use the angled brush, working the paint in both directions to coat the tongues and avoid missed spots.  \n   \u2022 Roll or spray the faces: Keep a wet edge to avoid lap marks. Work top-to-bottom for consistency.  \n   \u2022 Check for drips in the grooves; smooth them out before they set.  \n   Second Coat  \n   \u2022 After the first coat is fully dry, inspect and lightly sand any rough spots.  \n   \u2022 Repeat the brush-and-roll routine. The second coat evens out sheen and hides any primer show-through.\n\n5. Watch environmental conditions  \n   \u2022 Ideal painting temps: 50\u201385 \u00b0F (10\u201330 \u00b0C).  \n   \u2022 Low humidity speeds curing and reduces the chance of flashing (uneven sheen).\n\n6. Let it cure before heavy use  \n   \u2022 Latex feels dry to the touch in a few hours, but full cure can take 7\u201314 days. During that time, avoid pushing furniture directly against the boards or wiping aggressively.\n\nExtra tips  \n\u2022 If you prefer rustic \u201cnickel-gap\u201d lines, choose brushes/rollers sized to keep paint out of the recesses or run painter\u2019s tape in the grooves and remove it while the paint is still wet.  \n\u2022 Spraying can be faster on large expanses, but masking takes longer. If you\u2019re rolling, a smaller nap (\u00bc\") gives a smoother, almost sprayed look.  \n\u2022 For existing, glossy shiplap, use a chemical deglosser or a bonding primer (sometimes labeled \u201cadhesion primer\u201d) before painting.\n\nFollow those steps and you\u2019ll end up with a smooth, durable finish that still shows the classic shadow line that makes shiplap so distinctive.

Clean the surface  \n   \u2022 Wash the walls with warm water and a small amount of mild detergent (or a TSP substitute).  \n   \u2022 Rinse with clean water and let dry completely.  \n   \u2022 Remove any dust or cobwebs\u2014good adhesion starts with a clean surface.\n\n2. Repair and sand  \n   \u2022 Fill nail holes or small dings with a lightweight spackling compound; let it dry and sand flush.  \n   \u2022 Lightly scuff-sand the entire surface (120\u2013150-grit) to knock down sheen and create tooth for the new coatings.  \n   \u2022 Wipe away sanding dust with a damp cloth or tack cloth.\n\n3. Choose the right primer  \n   \u2022 Use a high-hide, stain-blocking primer\u2014look for labels that say \u201chigh hiding,\u201d \u201cstain blocking,\u201d or \u201cfor drastic color changes.\u201d  \n   \u2022 If the old paint is oil-based or very glossy, pick a bonding primer or de-gloss first.  \n   \u2022 Tinting the primer toward your new color can reduce the number of finish coats needed; most Zava paint desks can tint primer for you.\n\n4. Apply the primer correctly  \n   \u2022 Cut in around edges with a quality angled brush.  \n   \u2022 Roll the larger areas using a \u215c- to \u00bd-inch nap roller (\u215c\u2033 for smooth drywall, \u00bd\u2033 for lightly textured walls).  \n   \u2022 Lay the primer on generously enough to cover, but avoid thick, drippy coats.  \n   \u2022 Let dry according to the label\u2014typically 1\u20133 hours for water-based primers, 4+ for some stain blockers.\n\n5.

Below is a step-by-step guide you can follow with supplies you can pick up at any Zava DIY Hardware store.\n\n\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\nTools & Materials\n1. Drop cloth and painter\u2019s tape  \n2. Household cleaner or degreaser (Zava Citrus-Clean or similar)  \n3. 120- to 150-grit sanding sponge  \n4. Lint-free tack cloth  \n5. Bonding/adhesion primer for slick surfaces (e.g., Zinsser BIN Advanced, INSL-X STIX)  \n6. High-quality latex, acrylic enamel, or alkyd-hybrid furniture paint  \n7. \u00bc\" microfiber or high-density foam roller, 1\u20132\u2033 sash brush  \n8. Optional: Water-based polyurethane or furniture wax for a top-coat  \n9. Nitrile gloves, dust mask\n\n\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\nStep-by-Step\n\n1. Clear & Protect  \n   \u2022 Remove any leaves, hardware or drop-in extensions.  \n   \u2022 Lay down a drop cloth and tape off anything you don\u2019t want painted.\n\n2. Clean Thoroughly  \n   \u2022 Laminate is non-porous and holds onto oils. Wash with a degreaser, rinse, and let dry.  \n   \u2022 Any cleaner residue can keep paint from bonding, so wipe twice if necessary.\n\n3. Lightly Scuff-Sand  \n   \u2022 Using a 120- to 150-grit sanding sponge, scuff the entire laminate surface until it loses its glossy look.  \n   \u2022 You\u2019re not trying to expose wood\u2014just creating microscopic scratches for the primer to grip.\n\n4. Remove Dust  \n   \u2022 Vacuum or wipe with a damp rag, then go over everything with a tack cloth.  \n   \u2022 Dust left behind = peeling later.\n\n5. Apply Bonding Primer  \n   \u2022 Stir (don\u2019t shake) the primer to avoid bubbles.  \n   \u2022 Using a foam roller for the flat top and a brush for edges/legs, lay on a thin, even coat.  \n   \u2022 Let it self-level; resist over-brushing.  \n   \u2022 Most adhesion primers need 45\u201360 minutes to dry to the touch and 4\u20136 hours to cure enough for sanding or paint\u2014check the can.\n\n6. Light Sand & Clean Again  \n   \u2022 After primer dries, do a very light pass with a 220-grit sanding pad to knock down nibs.  \n   \u2022 Tack cloth off the dust.\n\n7. Paint (2\u20133 Coats)  \n   \u2022 Apply your chosen paint in thin, even layers with the foam roller; tip off edges with the sash brush.  \n   \u2022 Allow recommended dry time (usually 4\u20136 h for latex, 12\u201316 h for alkyd hybrids) before recoating.  \n   \u2022 Light sand between coats for an ultra-smooth finish.\n\n8. Optional Protective Top-Coat  \n   \u2022 For a kitchen table that sees heavy use, seal with 2\u20133 coats of water-based polyurethane (satin or semi-gloss).  \n   \u2022 Allow at least 24 h after the last paint coat before clear-coating.  \n   \u2022 If you prefer a soft, low-sheen finish, furniture wax works too but will need periodic re-application.\n\n9. Cure Time  \n   \u2022 \u201cDry\u201d and \u201ccured\u201d are different. Avoid heavy use for about 7 days so the finish can fully harden.\n\n\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\nExtra Tips\n\n\u2022 Temperature & Humidity: Work between 50 \u00b0F and 85 \u00b0F (10\u201329 \u00b0C) and < 60 % humidity for best adhesion and leveling.  \n\u2022 Brush Marks: A paint additive like Floetrol (for latex) or Penetrol (for alkyd) can extend open time and reduce brush strokes.  \n\u2022 Color Changes: Dark-to-light transitions may need a tinted primer or an additional coat of paint.  \n\u2022 Touch-Ups: Keep a small labeled jar of your mixed paint for future nicks and scratches.\n\n\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\nCommon Pitfalls to Avoid\n\n\u2718 Skipping the scuff-sand: Primer may still peel on a glossy, un-etched laminate.  \n\u2718 Thick coats: They dry on the surface but stay soft underneath, leading to dents and impressions.  \n\u2718 Using regular wood primer: It usually won\u2019t adhere well to the melamine/plastic surface of laminate.\n\n\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\nNeed Supplies or Advice?\n\nDrop by your local Zava DIY Hardware; we stock all the primers, furniture paints, rollers and sanding pads mentioned above.

Follow these steps and you\u2019ll get a finish that looks good and lasts years.\n\n1. Check the weather  \n   \u2022 Work on a dry day with temperatures between 10 \u00b0C and 30 \u00b0C (50 \u2013 86 \u00b0F).  \n   \u2022 Avoid painting in direct intense sun or when rain is forecast within 24 hours.\n\n2. Gather supplies  \n   \u2022 Wire brush or drill-mounted wire wheel  \n   \u2022 120- to 220-grit sandpaper or sanding sponge  \n   \u2022 Mild detergent (or TSP) and a bucket  \n   \u2022 Clean water and rags  \n   \u2022 Rust converter (if heavy rust is present)  \n   \u2022 Exterior metal primer (look for \u201cetching\u201d or \u201crust-inhibitive\u201d primer)  \n   \u2022 Exterior metal paint\u2014acrylic latex or solvent-based alkyd/enamel  \n   \u2022 High-quality synthetic brush and/or \u00bc-inch nap roller; optional: HVLP or airless sprayer  \n   \u2022 Painter\u2019s tape, drop cloths, nitrile gloves, safety glasses, mask/respirator\n\n3. Clear and protect the work area  \n   \u2022 Move lawn tools, bikes, etc. away from the shed.  \n   \u2022 Lay down drop cloths to catch chips and overspray.  \n   \u2022 Mask hinges, door handles, windows, and the slab perimeter with painter\u2019s tape.\n\n4. Remove loose rust and paint  \n   \u2022 Scrape any flaking paint with the wire brush.  \n   \u2022 Follow with sanding\u2014dull glossy areas so the primer can grip.  \n   \u2022 Vacuum or brush away dust.\n\n5. Degrease and wash  \n   \u2022 Mix detergent with warm water; scrub the entire shed.  \n   \u2022 Rinse thoroughly. Any residue left behind can cause peeling.  \n   \u2022 Let the metal dry completely (1\u20132 hours in warm weather).\n\n6. Treat rust (if needed)  \n   \u2022 For pitted or stubborn rust, apply a rust converter per the label.  \n   \u2022 It chemically neutralizes iron oxide and gives a primable surface.\n\n7. Prime  \n   \u2022 Stir (don\u2019t shake) the primer to avoid bubbles.  \n   \u2022 Apply one even coat with a brush/roller or spray.  \n   \u2022 Pay extra attention to seams and edges\u2014they\u2019re rust hot spots.  \n   \u2022 Allow the full recoat/curing time, usually 2\u20134 hours for acrylic primers, 24 hours for some alkyds.\n\n8. Paint  \n   \u2022 Stir the paint and strain it if you\u2019ll be spraying.  \n   \u2022 First coat: use long, even strokes; keep a wet edge to avoid lap marks.  \n   \u2022 Let it dry. Lightly scuff with 220-grit between coats for best adhesion.  \n   \u2022 Second coat: apply perpendicular to the first if rolling, or in a cross-hatch pattern if brushing.\n\n9.

Feel free to adjust product choices to match the brands you prefer or those available at your local Zava store.\n\n1. Inspect and plan  \n   \u2022 Check for structural damage or excessive corrosion\u2014if it\u2019s badly pitted or flaking, repair or replace the part first.  \n   \u2022 If the piece was painted before 1978, assume the old coating could contain lead. In that case, follow EPA Renovate Right guidelines or hire a lead-certified pro.\n\n2. Gather supplies  \n   \u2022 Safety gear: gloves, safety glasses, dust mask or respirator (rated for paint fumes and dust).  \n   \u2022 Drop cloths or plastic sheeting.  \n   \u2022 Wire brush, sanding block (80\u2013120 grit), and/or a drill with a wire-cup brush.  \n   \u2022 Clean rags, detergent (or a degreasing cleaner like TSP substitute).  \n   \u2022 Rust-inhibiting metal primer (oil-based or acrylic, \u201cfor ferrous metals\u201d or \u201cdirect-to-rust\u201d).  \n   \u2022 Exterior-grade enamel or metal-specific paint (oil-based alkyd or high-quality acrylic urethane).  \n   \u2022 Mineral spirits (if you\u2019re using oil-based products) for cleanup.  \n   \u2022 Good-quality natural-bristle (oil) or synthetic-bristle/foam brush (water-based). A small trim roller works for flat panels.\n\n3. Surface prep (the most important step)  \n   a. Remove loose paint and rust:  \n      \u2013 Scrape off flaking paint.  \n      \u2013 Wire-brush until you reach sound metal. Power-tool attachments speed this up but wear eye/ear protection.  \n   b. Smooth edges: Sand any remaining paint ridges so you\u2019re not priming over sharp \u201csteps.\u201d  \n   c. Clean: Wash with warm water plus detergent or degreaser; rinse thoroughly. Oil, dirt, or salts will cause new paint to peel.  \n   d. Dry completely: Iron holds moisture in crevices\u2014wait at least a couple of hours, or quicker with a leaf blower or compressed air.\n\n4. Apply rust-inhibiting primer  \n   \u2022 Stir (don\u2019t shake) the can to minimize bubbles.  \n   \u2022 Brush/roll a thin, even coat, working into scrolls and tight joints.  \n   \u2022 If rust was severe, use a \u201cconvert-and-prime\u201d product that neutralizes residual rust.  \n   \u2022 Let it cure per label\u2014typically 4\u201324 h. Lightly scuff with 220 grit if more than 24 h passes before top-coating.\n\n5. Paint  \n   \u2022 Two light coats outperform one thick one: fewer runs, better adhesion.  \n   \u2022 Maintain a wet edge; back-brush drips in crevices.  \n   \u2022 Respect recoat times (usually 2\u20134 h water-based, 8\u201316 h oil-based).  \n   \u2022 Final cure can take several days\u2014avoid hard contact until fully hardened.\n\n6. Optional clear coat  \n   Some manufacturers offer a UV-stable clear enamel for extra gloss and fade resistance. Only apply if the color coat is designed to accept it.\n\n7. Maintenance tips  \n   \u2022 Inspect yearly for chips. Touch up promptly\u2014small rust spots are easier than full re-painting.  \n   \u2022 Clean with mild soap; avoid harsh abrasives that can scratch the finish.\n\nQuick product cheatsheet (Zava aisle references may vary):  \n   \u2013 Zava \u201cPrimeGuard Rust-Block\u201d oil primer, Quart #291-034.  \n   \u2013 Zava \u201cExterior Enamel Pro\u201d high-gloss alkyd, Quart #401-110 (multiple colors).  \n   \u2013 3-Pack 1.5-in premium china-bristle brushes, SKU 812-703.  \n   \u2013 TSP-free degreaser, 32 oz spray, SKU 156-921.\n\nSafety reminders  \n\u2022 Work outdoors or in a well-ventilated garage; fumes from oil-based products are flammable.  \n\u2022 Keep spark sources away; store rags in a sealed, water-filled container to prevent spontaneous combustion.  \n\u2022 Dispose of solvents and used rags at a hazardous-waste collection site\u2014local regulations differ.\n\nFollow these steps and you should get 5\u201310 years (or more) of protection before a light touch-up is needed.

Gather your supplies  \n   \u2022 Drop cloths or plastic sheeting  \n   \u2022 Painter\u2019s tape  \n   \u2022 Soft-bristle broom or vacuum with brush attachment  \n   \u2022 Mild detergent and sponge (for washing)  \n   \u2022 Patch compound and putty knife (optional, for repairs)  \n   \u2022 2\u00bd\u20133\u2033 angled sash brush  \n   \u2022 \u00be\u2033 to 1\u00bc\u2033 nap roller covers (the rougher the texture, the thicker the nap)  \n   \u2022 Sturdy roller frame and extension pole  \n   \u2022 High-quality acrylic/latex primer (use stain-blocking primer if needed)  \n   \u2022 Interior paint (buy 10\u201315 % more than usual; texture increases surface area)  \n   \u2022 Paint tray or bucket/grid  \n   \u2022 Ladder, safety glasses, gloves, and respirator or N95 mask (if sanding or working in tight spaces)\n\n2. Prepare the room  \n   \u2022 Move furniture to the center and cover it; protect floors with drop cloths.  \n   \u2022 Mask off trim, windows, and outlets with painter\u2019s tape.  \n   \u2022 Good lighting helps you spot missed spots on textured surfaces\u2014set up work lights if necessary.\n\n3. Clean the walls  \n   \u2022 Dust or vacuum to remove cobwebs and debris caught in the texture.  \n   \u2022 Wash greasy or high-traffic areas with a mild detergent solution, then rinse with clean water.  \n   \u2022 Let walls dry completely before priming.\n\n4. Repair and caulk (optional)  \n   \u2022 Fill small divots or nail holes with patch compound; match the surrounding texture as best as possible.  \n   \u2022 Lightly sand any high ridges or patch edges. Wipe the surface clean.  \n   \u2022 Caulk gaps where trim meets the wall.\n\n5. Prime  \n   \u2022 Use a high-quality primer suited to your paint type (for most latex paints, use latex primer).  \n   \u2022 Cut in edges with the sash brush.  \n   \u2022 Roll the primer with a thick-nap roller: work in 3-x-3 ft sections, using a \u201cW\u201d or \u201cM\u201d pattern to push primer into the low spots.  \n   \u2022 Feather out edges to avoid lap lines.  \n   \u2022 Allow primer to dry fully (check label\u2014usually 1\u20134 hours).\n\n6. Inspect  \n   \u2022 After priming, shine a light across the surface. Touch up any missed crevices or thin spots.\n\n7. Paint  \n   \u2022 Stir paint thoroughly and pour into tray or bucket with grid.  \n   \u2022 Cut in around the ceiling line, corners, and baseboards first.  \n   \u2022 Roll the paint using the same \u201cW\u201d pattern. Apply firm, even pressure so the roller nap gets into the recesses.  \n   \u2022 Maintain a wet edge: overlap each pass slightly and avoid stopping mid-wall.  \n   \u2022 On highly textured walls (e.g., knockdown or heavy orange-peel), back-roll gently after each section: run the roller lightly over the area in one direction to even out stipple marks.  \n   \u2022 Let the first coat dry, then inspect. A second coat is typical on textured surfaces; a third may be needed for drastic color changes.\n\n8. Finishing touches  \n   \u2022 Remove tape while the last coat is still slightly tacky to minimize peeling.  \n   \u2022 Reinstall outlet covers and hardware when paint is fully dry.  \n   \u2022 Clean brushes and rollers immediately (warm soapy water for water-based paint).  \n   \u2022 Store touch-up paint labeled by room and date.\n\nHelpful tips  \n   \u2022 Roller naps: \u00be\u2033 is fine for light orange-peel; 1\u2033\u20131\u00bc\u2033 works best on knockdown, popcorn, or stucco-like textures.  \n   \u2022 If paint still doesn\u2019t reach recesses, try a specialty \u201ctexture roller\u201d or a mini\u2010roller to dab specific spots.  \n   \u2022 Use sheen to your advantage: flat or eggshell hides imperfections; satin or semi-gloss is scrubbable but highlights texture.  \n   \u2022 Work at comfortable shoulder height by using an extension pole rather than a ladder for large wall areas.\n\nProducts at Zava you might need  \n   \u2022 Zava Premium High-Build Primer  \n   \u2022 Zava Pro-Finish Interior Latex Paint (eggshell, satin, or semi-gloss)  \n   \u2022 Zava 1\u2033 Microfiber Roller Covers (3-pack)  \n   \u2022 Zava Angled Sash Brush (2\u00bd\u2033)  \n   \u2022 Zava Heavy-Duty Extension Pole (2\u20134 ft)\n\nSafety reminders  \n   \u2022 Ventilate the room: open windows, use fans, and wear a respirator if fumes bother you.  \n   \u2022 Keep paint and tools away from children and pets.  \n   \u2022 Dispose of used rags and paint cans per local regulations.\n\nWith patience and the right roller nap, textured walls can look just as crisp and uniform as smooth drywall.

Galvanised\u2010steel trays  \n   \u2022 Durability: Highest. Galvanised steel resists rust and dents far better than standard mild-steel trays.  \n   \u2022 Thickness matters: Aim for 0.6- to 0.8-mm sheet steel; thinner trays flex and eventually crease.  \n   \u2022 Downside: Heavier and a little more expensive.  \n\n2. Solvent-resistant polypropylene (rigid plastic) trays  \n   \u2022 Durability: Very good, provided the plastic is solvent resistant. Look for trays labelled \u201cPP\u201d or \u201cpolypropylene\u201d rather than generic \u201cplastic.\u201d  \n   \u2022 Key benefit: Lightweight and won\u2019t rust.  \n   \u2022 Downside: Can crack if you drop them on concrete in cold weather.  \n\n3. High-density polyethylene (HDPE) trays  \n   \u2022 Durability: Good for water-based paints, but HDPE is less solvent-resistant than polypropylene.  \n   \u2022 Tip: If you use only latex/acrylic paints, an HDPE tray with disposable liners can last a long time.  \n\n4. Aluminium trays  \n   \u2022 Durability: Moderate. Aluminium won\u2019t rust, but it bends more easily than steel. Useful if you need something lighter than steel but more rigid than plastic.  \n\nTop pick from Zava\u2019s range  \n\u2022 Zava Pro-Build Galvanised Steel Tray, 9-inch: 0.7-mm galvanised sheet, reinforced ribs, and a folded wire handle. Built for contractors\u2014customers typically get several years out of one tray.  \n\u2022 Runner-up: Zava Solvent-Safe Poly Tray, 9-inch: Injection-moulded polypropylene, integrated brush rest, and chemical-resistant to common paint strippers.\n\nMaintenance tips to maximise life  \n1. Use disposable liners for quick colour change and to keep the tray\u2019s surface intact.  \n2. If you skip liners, rinse immediately after each session\u2014dried-on paint is what eventually weakens seams and ridges.  \n3. For steel trays, allow them to dry fully before stacking to avoid trapped moisture.  \n\nIn short: a galvanised-steel tray is the most durable overall. If you prefer something lighter, go for a solvent-resistant polypropylene tray and use liners to get comparable longevity."}]}

Look for one (or more) of the following qualities:\n\n1. Shellac-based stain blocker  \n   \u2022 Fast drying (15\u201360 min recoats)  \n   \u2022 Excellent at locking in water, smoke, nicotine, tannin, and ink stains  \n   \u2022 Odor is strong, so use good ventilation and a proper respirator if possible  \n   \u2022 Cleanup with denatured alcohol (not water)  \n   Popular examples: Zinsser B-I-N\u00ae; Rust-Oleum\u00ae Shellac-Base Primer.\n\n2. Solvent/oil-based stain-blocking primer  \n   \u2022 Very good at stopping water stains, graffiti, knots, tannins, grease, smoke, etc.  \n   \u2022 Longer dry time (1\u20134 hrs to recoat) and stronger odor than latex.  \n   \u2022 Cleanup with mineral spirits.  \n   Popular examples: Zinsser Cover-Stain\u00ae, Kilz Original\u00ae, Sherwin-Williams ProBlock\u00ae Oil.\n\n3. High-quality water-based \u201chybrid\u201d stain blocker  \n   \u2022 Newer acrylic formulas combine stain-blocking with low odor and easy water cleanup.  \n   \u2022 Works well for light-to-moderate stains; for the worst smoke or water damage shellac is still best.  \n   Popular examples: Zinsser Bulls Eye 1-2-3\u00ae Plus, Kilz 3\u00ae Premium, Benjamin Moore Fresh Start\u00ae High-Hide.\n\nChoosing the right one:  \n\u2022 For severe smoke or water damage: go straight to a shellac primer for maximum blocking.  \n\u2022 For large areas where odor and cleanup matter (e.g., occupied homes): consider a high-end acrylic blocker, but spot-prime stubborn stains with shellac.  \n\u2022 For wood knots or cedar bleed: shellac or a dedicated alkyd stain blocker.  \n\u2022 For crayon, marker, lipstick: a quick coat of shellac or oil primer will lock it in.\n\nTips for best results  \n1. Clean the surface first. Scrub off soot, grease, loose material, and let walls dry completely.  \n2. Stir primer thoroughly; don\u2019t thin unless the label allows it.  \n3. Apply with a high-quality roller or brush rated for solvent if using shellac/oil.  \n4. Follow the manufacturer\u2019s dry-time and recoat window.  \n5. After priming, check for any stain \u201cshadows.\u201d If they show, apply a second primer coat before topcoat.\n\nIf you need help choosing a specific product or quantities, just let us know what stain type and room size you\u2019re working on, and we\u2019ll help you pick it up at your nearest Zava store."}]}

Assess the rust.\n   \u2022 Light surface rust (a thin, flaky layer) can often be cleaned and primed.\n   \u2022 Heavy, pitted rust may need more aggressive removal or part replacement.\n\n2. Gather supplies.\n   \u2022 Safety gear: goggles, dust mask or respirator, gloves.\n   \u2022 Wire brush or wire-wheel drill attachment.\n   \u2022 Medium-grit sandpaper (80\u2013120 grit).\n   \u2022 Rust converter or rust-inhibiting primer (labeled \u201cfor direct-to-rust\u201d or \u201crust-converting\u201d).\n   \u2022 Clean rags and a degreasing cleaner.\n   \u2022 High-quality paint suitable for the material (e.g., metal enamel or outdoor acrylic).\n   \u2022 Paintbrush, foam brush, or spray can, depending on project size.\n\n3. Remove loose rust and paint.\n   \u2022 Scrub with a wire brush to knock off flakes.\n   \u2022 Sand the area until the remaining rust feels smooth and the edges of any intact paint are feathered.\n\n4. Clean thoroughly.\n   \u2022 Wipe away dust with a clean rag.\n   \u2022 Degrease with a mild solvent or household degreasing cleaner.\n   \u2022 Let it dry completely\u2014paint won\u2019t adhere to damp or oily surfaces.\n\n5. Stabilize or convert any remaining rust.\n   \u2022 For light residual rust: Apply a rust converter product. It chemically changes iron oxide into a paintable, inert layer.\n   \u2022 Follow the product\u2019s dwell time and recoat instructions.\n\n6. Prime.\n   \u2022 Use a rust-inhibiting metal primer, even if you used a converter (many converters double as primers, but check the label).\n   \u2022 Apply in thin, even coats. Allow full drying/curing time between coats.\n\n7. Paint.\n   \u2022 Choose a paint compatible with the primer (often indicated on the can).\n   \u2022 Apply at least two thin coats, allowing the recommended drying time.\n   \u2022 For outdoor metal, a protective enamel or industrial-grade acrylic offers the best durability.\n\n8. Optional topcoat.\n   \u2022 If extra protection is needed (e.g., on outdoor furniture), add a clear coat formulated for metal after the paint cures.\n\nTips:\n\u2022 Work in a well-ventilated area or outdoors.\n\u2022 Keep an eye on weather conditions; temperature and humidity affect drying times.\n\u2022 If rust is severe and structural strength is compromised, replacement or professional repair is safer.\n\nWith careful prep and the right products, painted metal can look great and resist rust for years. Good luck with your project\u2014and if you need specific primers or paints, Zava\u2019s staff can point you to compatible options."}]}
