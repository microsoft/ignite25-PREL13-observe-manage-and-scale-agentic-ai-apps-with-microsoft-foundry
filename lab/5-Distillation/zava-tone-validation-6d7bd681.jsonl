Luckily, you can get a clean, professional-looking result with some simple tools and a little planning.\n\nStep-by-Step Guide\n\n1. Protect the toilet and floor\n   \u2022 Turn off the water supply valve (usually on the wall just below the tank) and flush once to lower the water level in the tank.  \n   \u2022 Lay a large trash bag or plastic sheet over the lid and tank; tape it in place so paint drips can\u2019t sneak through.  \n   \u2022 Drape a drop cloth or old towel around the base to catch splatter.  \n\n2. Decide whether to remove the tank\n   \u2022 Most people leave the tank in place; it\u2019s faster and avoids plumbing work.  \n   \u2022 If the gap behind the tank is less than 2\u2033 (5 cm) and you need a flawless finish for resale or a color change from dark to light, you can detach just the tank\u2014usually two bolts and the water-supply line. Have a bucket and a few old towels ready.  \n\n3. Use the right applicators\n   \u2022 Angled sash brush (1\u00bd\u2033\u20132\u2033): Great for cutting in the edge where wall meets tank.  \n   \u2022 Mini roller (4\u2033) with a short-nap (\u00bc\u2033) sleeve: Fits behind most tanks and gives an even texture that matches the rest of the wall.  \n   \u2022 Paint pad on an extendable handle: Super-thin profile\u2014slides in gaps as tight as \u00be\u2033.  \n\n4. Cut in first\n   \u2022 Dip the angled brush, tap off excess paint, and carefully \u201ccut in\u201d along the tank edges and corners. Work slowly; a steady hand here means less touch-up later.  \n\n5. Roll or pad the rest\n   \u2022 Load a mini roller or paint pad lightly (too much paint causes drips in the small space).  \n   \u2022 Start at the top behind the tank, working downward in slow, overlapping strokes.  \n   \u2022 If you can\u2019t see well, use a flashlight or a hand mirror to check coverage.  \n\n6. Feather the edges\n   \u2022 Where the mini roller\u2019s reach ends, lightly overlap into the previously painted area of the wall so the new paint blends seamlessly.  \n\n7. Second coat & clean-up\n   \u2022 Let the first coat dry as directed (usually 1\u20132 hours for most interior latex). Apply a second coat for uniform color.  \n   \u2022 Carefully peel the taped plastic off the tank while the paint is still slightly tacky to avoid peeling.  \n   \u2022 Re-open the water valve, let the tank fill, and give it a flush to make sure everything\u2019s tight.  \n\nTool & Product Suggestions (available at Zava)\n   \u2022 Zava 2\u2033 Pro-Cut Angled Brush  \n   \u2022 Zava 4\u2033 Micro-Fiber Mini Roller Kit (\u00bc\u2033 nap)  \n   \u2022 Zava SlimLine Paint Pad with 12\u2033 telescoping handle  \n   \u2022 Painter\u2019s plastic (9 ft \u00d7 12 ft) & 1.41\u2033 blue painter\u2019s tape  \n   \u2022 Interior bathroom-grade latex paint (mildew-resistant)  \n\nQuick Tips\n   \u2022 Wear gloves; the tight space makes accidental knuckle skims against wet paint likely.  \n   \u2022 For new-color walls, tint your primer to the finish color\u2014fewer coats behind the tank.  \n   \u2022 Keep a damp rag handy; if you do bump the porcelain, a quick wipe removes fresh latex easily.  \n\nWith the right brush or pad, you\u2019ll be done in roughly the same time it takes to paint any other wall section\u2014no plumber required. Happy painting, and don\u2019t hesitate to drop by Zava if you need supplies or have any other DIY questions!"}]}

Strain or wipe the rim clean.  \n   \u2022 Before you close the can, use a rag or paper towel to remove paint from the groove around the rim. Dried paint here prevents an airtight seal.\n\n2. Transfer if the can is mostly empty.  \n   \u2022 Air is paint\u2019s biggest enemy. If the can is less than half full, pour the paint into a smaller, clean container (a quart-sized paint can, a glass canning jar, or a well-sealed plastic food container that\u2019s HDPE or PET).  \n   \u2022 Leave just a little headspace\u2014about \u00bd in / 1 cm\u2014for expansion.\n\n3. Cover first, then close.  \n   \u2022 Lay a layer of plastic wrap (or wax paper) directly on the paint surface to block air.  \n   \u2022 Wipe the container rim, place another piece of plastic wrap over the opening, then press the lid on firmly.  \n   \u2022 For metal paint cans, tap the lid down with a rubber mallet, working around the edge. Avoid a steel hammer\u2014dents can break the seal.\n\n4. Label it clearly.  \n   \u2022 Use masking tape or a paint-can label to note: colour/name, date stored, and the room or project it belongs to. A dab of the paint on the label helps, too.\n\n5. Store in a stable, moderate environment.  \n   \u2022 Ideal range: about 50\u201385 \u00b0F (10\u201330 \u00b0C).  \n   \u2022 Avoid freezing, direct sun, damp basements, and places that get hot (like a garage near a furnace or water heater).  \n   \u2022 Set the container right-side up on a shelf; don\u2019t store it directly on concrete floors, which can draw moisture into metal cans.\n\n6. Check periodically.  \n   \u2022 If a thin \u201cskin\u201d forms, peel it off; strain the paint through a fine mesh paint strainer or nylon stocking before use.  \n   \u2022 Stir thoroughly; if it stays lumpy or smells sour, it\u2019s time to dispose of it.\n\n7. Dispose of paint responsibly.  \n   \u2022 Many municipalities let latex paint fully dry (add kitty litter or a commercial paint hardener) before placing it in household trash.  \n   \u2022 Oil-based and alkyd paints are considered hazardous waste\u2014take them to a local collection facility.  \n   \u2022 Always follow local regulations.\n\nBonus tip  \nIf you\u2019re using Zava\u2019s in-store colour-matching service, keep your purchase receipt or snap a photo of the colour formula printed on the can lid. That code lets us reproduce the shade later, even if the original paint has gone bad.\n\nBy following these steps, you can typically keep latex paint usable for up to 5 years and oil-based paint for 10 years or more."}]}

The basic steps are:\n\n1. Choose the right coating system\n2. Empty, mask and ventilate the room\n3. Clean and de-gloss the surface\n4. Repair any chips or cracks\n5. Prime\n6. Apply finish coats\n7. Allow proper cure time\n\nBelow is a complete walk-through with products typically stocked in a DIY hardware store like Zava.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n1. Pick a compatible coating system\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\u2022 Primer: Look for an epoxy or urethane bonding primer designed for \u201cfiberglass/tile/tub & shower.\u201d (Klenk\u2019s, Rust-Oleum Tub & Tile Epoxy Primer, or Homax Tough As Tile, for example.)  \n\u2022 Top-coat/paint: A 2-part epoxy acrylic or 2-part polyurethane formulated for bath fixtures. Single-part spray enamels will not hold up to hot water immersion.  \n\u2022 Optional clear coat: A water-clear polyurethane for extra gloss and scratch resistance.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n2. Prep the bathroom\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\u2022 Remove caulk, shower doors, hardware and drain trim if possible.  \n\u2022 Clean everything out of the area and cover floors & walls with drop cloths or poly sheeting.  \n\u2022 Set up a box fan in the window and wear an organic-vapour respirator: epoxies off-gas solvents.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n3. Clean & de-gloss\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nA. Degrease  \n   \u2022 Scrub the tub thoroughly with a household degreaser (TSP, Zava Heavy-Duty Cleaner, or similar).  \n   \u2022 Rinse twice and let dry.\n\nB. Etch / dull the gloss  \n   \u2022 Sand the whole surface with 220- to 320-grit wet/dry sandpaper or a maroon Scotch-Brite pad until the original gloss is gone.  \n   \u2022 Vacuum and wipe with a tack cloth or lint-free rag dampened with isopropyl alcohol.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n4. Repair any flaws\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\u2022 Hairline cracks, chips or pin-holes should be filled with a marine epoxy putty or fiberglass repair filler.  \n\u2022 Sand flush when cured and clean again with alcohol.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n5. Mask & tack\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\u2022 Run painter\u2019s tape along the tile line and over any fixtures/drains that you couldn\u2019t remove.  \n\u2022 Wipe once more with a tac-cloth to remove dust.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n6. Prime\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\u2022 Mix your 2-part bonding primer exactly as the label states (usually 1:1) and allow the induction time (5\u201310 min).  \n\u2022 Apply with a \u00bc-inch microfiber roller or an HVLP sprayer if you have one.  \n\u2022 \u201cTip-off\u201d rolled areas lightly with a high-quality 2\u20132\u00bd-inch sash brush to knock down bubbles.  \n\u2022 Allow the primer to flash-off (about 1 hr) or until it\u2019s just past tacky but still in the recoat window, per manufacturer.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n7. Apply finish coats\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\u2022 Mix the 2-part tub epoxy paint; many systems give you ~4-6 hr working time.  \n\u2022 Apply a thin, even first coat. Don\u2019t chase minor roller texture; it levels as it cures.  \n\u2022 Wait the recommended interval (usually 1\u20132 hr) and apply a second coat. A third coat can add depth if time allows.  \n\u2022 Maintain temp 70\u201375 \u00b0F (21\u201324 \u00b0C) and humidity below 60 % for best flow-out.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n8. Optional clear coat\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nIf you want maximum gloss and stain resistance, let the colored epoxy cure for 4\u20136 hr, then apply a 2-part clear polyurethane (same technique as above).\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n9. Cure & re-assemble\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\u2022 Dust-free: 1\u20132 hr  \n\u2022 Light use (no standing water): 24 hr  \n\u2022 Full cure: 3\u20135 days (check your product). During that period, keep the room warm and ventilated and avoid dropping objects in the tub.  \n\u2022 Re-caulk the tub perimeter with 100 % silicone after the surface is fully cured.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nMaterials checklist (available at Zava)\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\u2022 TSP or heavy-duty cleaner & nylon scrub pad  \n\u2022 220\u2013320-grit wet/dry sandpaper or maroon Scotch-Brite pads  \n\u2022 Marine epoxy filler (if needed)  \n\u2022 Painter\u2019s tape, plastic sheeting, drop cloths  \n\u2022 2-part epoxy/urethane bonding primer  \n\u2022 2-part tub & tile epoxy or polyurethane top-coat  \n\u2022 (Optional) 2-part clear poly finish  \n\u2022 \u00bc-in microfiber roller covers, foam brushes for tipping, paint tray liners  \n\u2022 Organic-vapour respirator, gloves, safety glasses  \n\u2022 Tack cloths, lint-free rags, isopropyl alcohol  \n\u2022 Caulk & caulk gun for re-sealing\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nTips & trouble-shooting\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\u2022 Bubbles or fisheyes = leftover soap, silicone or oil. Re-sand, solvent wipe and start a new coat.  \n\u2022 \u201cOrange peel\u201d texture = high humidity, thick coat or roller nap too long. Sand lightly once cured and add another coat.  \n\u2022 Peeling later on is almost always poor prep\u2014proper sanding and cleaning are the number-one success factor.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nNeed help picking exact products?\nBring photos or the tub\u2019s make/model to any Zava location and we\u2019ll match primers, colors and clear coats and cut the quantities so you don\u2019t over-buy.
