Label, remove and set aside hardware  \n   \u2022 Place a small piece of masking tape inside each door and on its matching hinge location to keep track of where everything goes.  \n   \u2022 Unscrew hinges, pulls and knobs. Bag the screws so nothing is lost.\n\n2. Clean and degrease thoroughly  \n   \u2022 Kitchen doors usually have an invisible film of cooking oils. Wash with warm water, a scouring pad and a degreaser such as Krud Kutter, TSP substitute or Zava Citrus-Clean.  \n   \u2022 Rinse and let the doors dry completely.\n\n3. Lightly sand the existing finish  \n   \u2022 Use 120- to 150-grit sandpaper or a medium sanding sponge. The goal isn\u2019t to remove all the old paint or varnish\u2014just scuff the surface so new primer can bond.  \n   \u2022 Vacuum or wipe off all dust with a tack cloth.\n\n4. Fill dings and deep grain (optional)  \n   \u2022 For dents or open wood grain, apply a thin layer of wood filler or spackling compound.  \n   \u2022 Let it dry, sand smooth with 180- to 220-grit, then remove dust again.\n\n5. Mask and set up a painting area  \n   \u2022 Lay doors flat on risers (old soup cans or scrap blocks) to keep edges off the work surface.  \n   \u2022 Mask hinge recesses and the back edges you don\u2019t plan to coat.\n\n6. Apply a bonding primer  \n   \u2022 Use a stain-blocking, adhesion-promoting primer such as Zinsser BIN (shellac-based) or Zava All-Surface Bonding Primer.  \n   \u2022 Brush edges first with a quality angled sash brush, then roll the flat panels with a 4\" high-density foam or microfiber roller for a spray-like finish.  \n   \u2022 Allow the primer to dry per the label (usually 1\u20132 hours) and sand lightly with 220-grit for ultra-smooth results. Remove dust.\n\n7. Paint two (sometimes three) thin coats  \n   \u2022 Choose a trim/cabinet enamel; water-based alkyds and urethane-fortified acrylics level out well and cure hard (e.g., Benjamin Moore Advance, Sherwin-Williams Emerald Urethane, or Zava Pro-Level Cabinet Enamel).  \n   \u2022 Stir, don\u2019t shake, to avoid bubbles.  \n   \u2022 Brush edges, roll the flats, tipping off lightly with the brush in the direction of the grain.  \n   \u2022 Maintain a wet edge; thin coats dry faster and reduce drips.  \n   \u2022 Lightly sand between coats with 320-grit and tack-cloth clean.\n\n8. Let the paint cure fully  \n   \u2022 Surface-dry times can be a few hours, but cabinet enamels reach full hardness in 5\u20137 days. Rehang doors after 24\u201348 hours if space is tight, but avoid heavy use until cured.\n\n9. Reinstall hardware and doors  \n   \u2022 Consider updating pulls or knobs while you have everything apart.  \n   \u2022 Tighten hinges so doors hang square and close uniformly.\n\nExtra tips and tools you\u2019ll find at Zava:  \n\u2022 Tack cloths, painter\u2019s pyramids or plastic triangles for elevating doors.  \n\u2022 Dust-free sanding sponges (Festool or Mirka).  \n\u2022 A 4\" mini cabinet/door roller frame and smooth-finish microfiber sleeves.  \n\u2022 Nitrile gloves and a NIOSH-rated dust mask for sanding.  \n\u2022 Soft-close hinge upgrades if you want a modern touch.\n\nFollowing these steps will leave you with a factory-smooth, durable finish that can stand up to everyday kitchen abuse. Happy painting, and let us know if you need help matching colors or choosing the right primer and roller\u2014we\u2019re here to help!"}]}

All the products mentioned are standard DIY items you can find at Zava or any full-line hardware store.\n\n1. Inspect and test for contaminants  \n   \u2022 Check for insect activity, moisture, or rot. If you find soft spots or powdery frass, treat or replace those areas first.  \n   \u2022 If the beams are very old, do a quick lead-paint test on any existing finish.\n\n2. Clean the surface thoroughly  \n   \u2022 Vacuum with a brush attachment to pull dust out of cracks.  \n   \u2022 Scrub with a stiff nylon brush and a solution of warm water + mild detergent (or TSP substitute).  \n   \u2022 Rinse with clean water and let the beams dry 24\u201348 h so all moisture disperses.\n\n3. Remove loose material and smooth high spots  \n   \u2022 Lightly scrape off flaking paint or sap with a carbide scraper.  \n   \u2022 For heavily textured or gouged spots, a 60\u201380-grit sanding sponge works better than sheet sandpaper because it conforms to the contours.  \n   \u2022 Wipe down again with a tack cloth or vacuum.\n\n4. Decide on the look: opaque paint vs. translucent stain  \n   \u2022 Paint hides more imperfections and gives a uniform color. Use high-quality acrylic or alkyd enamel for interior beams, an exterior-rated paint if they\u2019re exposed to weather.  \n   \u2022 Stain or whitewash keeps the grain visible. Choose an oil-based penetrating stain for deeper, rustic character or a water-based stain for faster dry time and lower odor.\n\n5. Prime (unless using stain)  \n   \u2022 Go with a bonding primer labeled \u201chigh-hide\u201d or \u201cstain-blocking.\u201d Zava\u2019s ProGrip Multi-Surface Primer works on rough-sawn lumber and knots.  \n   \u2022 Brush in both directions to work primer into cracks. Let it dry per label\u2014typically 4 h for water-based, 8\u201312 h for oil-based.\n\n6. Caulk and fill as needed  \n   \u2022 For gaps between beam and drywall or beam and beam, use a paintable acrylic-latex or elastomeric sealant.  \n   \u2022 Leave small checking or natural cracks if you like the rustic look; just remove dust so paint adheres inside them.\n\n7. Apply topcoat  \n   \u2022 First Coat: Use a good 2\u20132\u00bd-inch angled sash brush or a \u00bc-nap mini roller, then \u201ctip off\u201d with the brush to avoid roller texture. Work in 3- to 4-ft sections to maintain a wet edge.  \n   \u2022 Second Coat: After the first coat cures (usually overnight for water-based, 24 h for oil-based), scuff-sand lightly with 180-grit to knock down raised grain, wipe clean, then apply the final coat.  \n   \u2022 For stains: Wipe or spray on, wait the recommended dwell time, and wipe off excess. Follow with a clear matte or satin polyurethane if you need extra durability.\n\n8. Ventilate and cure  \n   \u2022 Open windows, run fans, and keep HVAC filters clean. Most modern low-VOC paints reach full hardness in 7\u201330 days, so avoid heavy scrubbing or hanging loads during that time.\n\nHelpful tips  \n\u2022 Sample first: Rustic wood absorbs finish unevenly. Brush tests on the back or an off-cut to confirm color and coverage.  \n\u2022 Mind temperature/humidity: Ideal painting conditions are 50\u201385 \u00b0F (10\u201329 \u00b0C) and RH below 70 %.  \n\u2022 Protect floors and furnishings: Canvas drop cloths catch drips better than plastic (which can get slippery).\n\nSuggested Zava aisle picks  \n\u2022 Zava ProGrip Multi-Surface Primer  \n\u2022 Heritage Series Rustic-Beam Paint (matte, eggshell, or satin)  \n\u2022 TimberGuard Deep-Penetrating Oil Stain  \n\u2022 Zava #2285 Angled Sash Brush (2\u00bd in.)  \n\u2022 Quick-Dry Acrylic-Latex Caulk (paintable)  \n\u2022 \u00bc-Nap Microfiber Mini Rollers (for rough surfaces)  \n\u2022 N95 dust mask, safety glasses, and nitrile gloves\n\nAs always, read and follow each product\u2019s label. If you have unusually soft, historic beams or suspect structural issues, it\u2019s wise to consult a licensed contractor or preservation specialist.\n\nGood luck with your project, and let us know if you need any more help choosing supplies!"}]}

Here\u2019s a straightforward, step-by-step plan:\n\n1. Gather supplies  \n   \u2022 Trisodium phosphate (TSP) or a heavy-duty degreasing cleaner  \n   \u2022 Scuff-sanding pads (220- or 320-grit) or sanding block  \n   \u2022 Tack cloth or lint-free rags  \n   \u2022 High-adhesion bonding primer (water-based or shellac-based)  \n   \u2022 High-quality trim/door enamel or cabinet paint (satin, semi-gloss, or gloss finish)  \n   \u2022 Angled sash brush (2\u20132\u00bd\") and/or 4\u20136\" foam or microfiber roller  \n   \u2022 Painter\u2019s tape, drop cloths, and clean stir sticks  \n   \u2022 Optional: liquid deglosser, wood filler, new hardware, small foam brush for tight corners  \n\n   Everything listed can be found in Zava\u2019s paint aisle\u2014just ask if you need help picking a brand.\n\n2. Remove doors and hardware  \n   \u2022 Label each door and its hinges (painter\u2019s tape works well) so you can put them back in the right place.  \n   \u2022 Lay doors flat on trestles or a large work surface covered with drop cloths.\n\n3. Clean thoroughly  \n   \u2022 Glossy cabinets often have grease buildup. Mix TSP/degreaser as directed, scrub, rinse, and let dry.  \n   \u2022 Don\u2019t skip this\u2014it\u2019s what prevents adhesion problems later.\n\n4. Scuff-sand the gloss  \n   \u2022 Lightly sand all surfaces with 220- or 320-grit to break the shine; you\u2019re not removing all finish, just dulling it.  \n   \u2022 If you prefer, wipe on a liquid deglosser afterward, following its label directions.  \n   \u2022 Vacuum sanding dust and wipe with a tack cloth so the surface is completely clean.\n\n5. Spot-fill and caulk (if needed)  \n   \u2022 Fill nicks or old hardware holes with wood filler; sand smooth when dry.  \n   \u2022 Caulk gaps where cabinet stiles meet walls for a cleaner look.\n\n6. Prime with a bonding primer  \n   \u2022 A dedicated bonding primer is designed to grip slick surfaces. Shellac-based is best for stain blocking; water-based low-VOC options are easier to clean up.  \n   \u2022 Apply a thin, even coat with a brush for edges and a foam/microfiber roller for flats.  \n   \u2022 Let the primer cure fully (check the can; usually 1\u20134 hours to recoat, but 24 hours for max adhesion).\n\n7. Light sand the primer  \n   \u2022 Once cured, lightly sand again with 320-grit to smooth brush marks and ensure a silky final finish.  \n   \u2022 Wipe away dust.\n\n8. Paint two (sometimes three) top coats  \n   \u2022 Use a cabinet-rated enamel or urethane-reinforced acrylic\u2014these cure hard and scrubable.  \n   \u2022 Stir (don\u2019t shake) paint to avoid bubbles.  \n   \u2022 Apply thin coats; thick coats lead to runs and a gummy feel.  \n   \u2022 Allow each coat to dry per label instructions (usually 4\u20136 hours for acrylics) before recoating.\n\n9. Cure time  \n   \u2022 Even after paint feels dry, full cure can take 7\u201330 days. During that time, avoid heavy scrubbing or banging doors.\n\n10. Reassemble  \n   \u2022 Reinstall hardware and mount doors only when paint is dry to the touch (often overnight).  \n   \u2022 If you swapped hinges or handles, drill pilot holes to prevent splitting.\n\nExtra tips\n\u2022 Work in a dust-free area with good ventilation.  \n\u2022 Maintain a wet edge to minimize brush strokes\u2014foam rollers and quality bristle/nylon brushes help.  \n\u2022 If you want ultra-smooth factory results, lightly sand between top coats and wipe clean.  \n\nThat\u2019s it! With the gloss scuffed, a strong primer underneath, and patience for proper drying, your freshly painted cabinets should resist chipping and look professionally done. Good luck, and let us know at Zava if you need color samples, new pulls, or additional advice."}]}

Prepare the surface properly\n   \u2022 Clean off dust, grease and old loose paint.  \n   \u2022 Scuff glossy surfaces lightly with 320- to 400-grit paper so the paint has \u201ctooth.\u201d  \n   \u2022 Wipe with a tack cloth and let the surface dry.\n\n2. Bring the paint to the right condition\n   \u2022 Shake the can a full 1\u20132 minutes after you hear the ball rattle, and shake again for 5\u201310 seconds every minute while spraying.  \n   \u2022 If the weather is cool (below 60 \u00b0F / 15 \u00b0C), warm the can in lukewarm water for 5 minutes. Never use hot water or flame.  \n   \u2022 Use a quality brand; bargain paints often have thinner resin that runs easily. (At Zava we stock Rust-Oleum 2X Ultra Cover, Krylon Fusion, and Montana Gold\u2014good choices with low-drip fan caps.)\n\n3. Control distance and angle\n   \u2022 Hold the nozzle 8\u201312 in (20\u201330 cm) from the surface\u2014closer than 6 in risks puddling, farther than 12 in produces orange-peel texture.  \n   \u2022 Keep the can as upright as possible; tilting past 45 \u00b0 can sputter propellant and leave wet blobs.\n\n4. Use thin, even coats\n   \u2022 Start spraying just off the edge of the work, sweep across in one smooth pass, and release the trigger only after you\u2019re past the opposite edge.  \n   \u2022 Overlap each pass by about 30\u201350 %.  \n   \u2022 If you see a wet spot forming, move on; do not try to \u201cfix\u201d it while it\u2019s wet or it will sag.  \n   \u2022 Two or three light coats are far safer than one heavy coat. Observe the flash time on the can (usually 5\u201310 min) between coats.\n\n5. Keep the nozzle clean\n   \u2022 Wipe it occasionally with a lint-free cloth.  \n   \u2022 If the nozzle clogs, remove and soak it in mineral spirits or replace it\u2014most brands sell spare fan-spray nozzles at Zava for under \u20ac2.\n\n6. Watch your environment\n   \u2022 Ideal temperature: 65\u201385 \u00b0F (18\u201329 \u00b0C).  \n   \u2022 Humidity below 65 % prevents trapped moisture that can cause runs.  \n   \u2022 Avoid direct wind; a light breeze will push wet paint into thick ridges.\n\n7. Practice first\n   \u2022 A scrap piece of cardboard lets you dial in speed, distance and coverage before you touch the real project.\n\nIf a drip does happen:\n   \u2022 Let it dry completely (often 2\u20134 hours or overnight).  \n   \u2022 Wet-sand just the run with 600- to 800-grit paper until level.  \n   \u2022 Wipe clean, then re-mist the area with two light coats.\n\nSafety reminders\n   \u2022 Spray only in a well-ventilated space or outdoors, away from open flames.  \n   \u2022 Wear an NIOSH-approved paint respirator, gloves and safety glasses.\n\nWith the right prep, light passes and a steady hand, drips become a non-issue.

Start with a clean rim  \n   \u2022 Before you put the lid back on, wipe any paint out of the groove around the rim. Dried-on paint prevents the lid from seating tightly and lets air sneak in.  \n   \u2022 A rag dampened with water (for latex) or mineral spirits (for oil-based) works well.  \n\n2. Add a disposable \u201cgasket\u201d  \n   \u2022 Lay a piece of plastic wrap, wax paper, or a cut-to-size plastic shopping bag over the opening before seating the lid.  \n   \u2022 The film creates an extra barrier and helps keep paint off the lid, so it\u2019s easier to reopen later.\n\n3. Reseat the lid with gentle, even pressure  \n   \u2022 Use a rubber mallet rather than a metal hammer; a metal hammer can warp the lid and ruin the seal.  \n   \u2022 Tap your way around the rim, moving a few inches at a time until the lid sits flush all the way around.  \n\n4. Eliminate headspace  \n   \u2022 Air is the enemy. If the can is less than half full, pour the leftover paint into a smaller, clean, airtight container (e.g., a quart can, a mason jar, or a purpose-made plastic paint saver).  \n   \u2022 Label the new container with the color name/number, sheen, room, and date.\n\n5. Store the can upside down (for latex paints only)  \n   \u2022 Turning the can upside down lets the paint itself form an additional seal around the lid.  \n   \u2022 Skip this step for oil-based or alkyd paints; small solvent leaks could make a mess.\n\n6. Keep it in a stable, moderate environment  \n   \u2022 Ideal range: 50 \u00b0F \u2013 85 \u00b0F (10 \u00b0C \u2013 29 \u00b0C).  \n   \u2022 Avoid direct sunlight, unheated sheds/garages in winter, and places where cans can rust (damp concrete floors).  \n   \u2022 Store on a wooden shelf or pallet, off the ground.\n\n7. Consider a paint conditioner for long-term storage  \n   \u2022 Products such as Floetrol (latex) or Penetrol (oil-based) help maintain flow and reduce skinning, especially if you don\u2019t plan to use the paint for a year or more.  \n   \u2022 Follow the manufacturer\u2019s recommended ratios\u2014usually a few ounces per gallon.\n\n8. Check periodically  \n   \u2022 If a thin \u201cskin\u201d forms, punch through it and strain the paint through a fine mesh screen or paint strainer before use.  \n   \u2022 If paint smells sour, looks chunky, or won\u2019t mix back to a smooth consistency, it\u2019s time to dispose of it responsibly (most municipalities have household hazardous-waste drop-off days).\n\nTools and supplies available at Zava  \n\u2022 Rubber mallet  \n\u2022 Replacement quart and gallon paint cans with lids  \n\u2022 Plastic paint-saver lids with pour spouts  \n\u2022 Paint strainers and mesh filters  \n\u2022 Floetrol and Penetrol conditioners  \n\u2022 Paint-can clip labels and color-matching stickers\n\nBy combining a tight seal with minimal air inside the container and storing the paint in a temperate spot, you can easily extend the usable life of most paints to five years or more.

It\u2019s classed as a \u201cmulti-surface\u201d or \u201call-purpose\u201d primer and is stocked in most Zava stores.\n\nWhy 1-2-3 is popular  \n\u2022 Adhesion: Sticks to bare or previously-painted drywall, wood, MDF, fibreglass, PVC, galvanized metal, aluminum, masonry, brick, stucco, tile, glass and even lightly chalky or glossy surfaces.  \n\u2022 Interior & exterior rated: Handles temperature swings and moisture better than many standard primers.  \n\u2022 Stain blocking: Seals light water marks, tannin bleed, smoke odour and crayon/marker so they don\u2019t bleed through the finish coat.  \n\u2022 Fast dry & low odour: Re-coat in about an hour; soap-and-water clean-up.  \n\u2022 Low-VOC: Safer for enclosed spaces than older oil-based products.\n\nOther multi-surface options if you need something specific  \n1. KILZ 2 All-Purpose Primer \u2013 similar water-based formula, good for drywall, wood and masonry.  \n2. Rust-Oleum Universal Bonding Primer \u2013 excels on slick plastics, laminates and powder-coated metal.  \n3. Zinsser B-I-N (shellac based) \u2013 best at heavy stain/odour blocking (nicotine, knots, smoke) but higher odour and denatured-alcohol clean-up.  \n4. Behr Multi-Surface Stain-Blocking Primer & Sealer \u2013 budget-friendly and tintable.\n\nChoosing the right one  \n\u2022 Surface type: For routine drywall, trim or masonry, 1-2-3 or KILZ 2 is plenty. For very glossy plastic, tile or melamine, step up to a bonding primer. For stubborn stains/odours, use a shellac or alkyd formula.  \n\u2022 Topcoat compatibility: All of the water-based primers above accept both latex and most alkyd finish paints.  \n\u2022 Environment: If you\u2019re working indoors in winter, stick with a low-VOC, water-based product that can cure below 10 \u00b0C (1-2-3 works down to 5 \u00b0C).\n\nApplication tips  \n1. Clean and de-gloss: Remove dust, grease and loose paint. Lightly scuff glossy surfaces with 180-grit.  \n2. Stir thoroughly.  \n3. Brush, roll or airless-spray one uniform coat.  \n4.

Base chemistry  \n   \u2022 Water-based: Urethane resins are carried in water.  \n   \u2022 Oil-based: Urethane resins are carried in a solvent (usually mineral-spirit\u2013based alkyd oil).\n\n2. Appearance & color shift  \n   \u2022 Water-based: Goes on milky white, dries crystal-clear. Resists ambering, so light woods (maple, birch, ash) stay close to their natural color.  \n   \u2022 Oil-based: Dries to a warm, amber tone that deepens over time\u2014great for enhancing grain on walnut, oak or cherry.\n\n3. Sheen & film build  \n   \u2022 Water-based: Thinner viscosity. You\u2019ll usually need 3\u20134 coats to equal the build of 2 coats of oil-based.  \n   \u2022 Oil-based: Higher solids content, so it builds a thicker protective film in fewer coats.\n\n4. Dry-time & recoating  \n   \u2022 Water-based: Dust-free in 30\u201345 min, recoat in 2 hrs, light use overnight, full cure in ~7 days.  \n   \u2022 Oil-based: Dust-free in 4\u20136 hrs, recoat in 12\u201324 hrs, light use in 48 hrs, full cure in ~30 days.\n\n5. Durability & scratch resistance  \n   \u2022 Both create a tough finish.  \n   \u2022 Oil-based edges out on chemical resistance and long-term abrasion, making it a favorite for high-traffic hardwood floors.  \n   \u2022 Premium water-based \u201cfloor\u201d formulations close the gap and are perfectly serviceable for residential traffic.\n\n6. Odor, VOCs & cleanup  \n   \u2022 Water-based: Low odor, very low VOC versions available. Soap-and-water cleanup. Safer for occupied houses and tight spaces.  \n   \u2022 Oil-based: Stronger solvent smell; higher VOCs (must observe local regulations). Requires mineral spirits for brushes and spills.\n\n7. Application temperature & humidity  \n   \u2022 Water-based: Sensitive to temps below 50 \u00b0F (10 \u00b0C) and high humidity; can raise grain, so a light pre-sand (220-grit) between coats is recommended.  \n   \u2022 Oil-based: More forgiving in marginal temps; self-levels better, leaving fewer brush marks.\n\nCost comparison  \n   \u2022 Water-based costs roughly 25\u201340 % more per quart or gallon, but labor savings (fast dry) can offset that in pro settings.\n\nWhen to choose which:\n\nChoose water-based polyurethane if you\u2026  \n   \u2022 Need a crystal-clear coat that won\u2019t yellow.  \n   \u2022 Want quick turnaround time\u2014e.g., rental units, commercial spaces, baby furniture.  \n   \u2022 Prefer low odor / lower VOCs.  \n   \u2022 Are finishing white-painted or very light-colored wood.\n\nChoose oil-based polyurethane if you\u2026  \n   \u2022 Want a warm, amber glow that accentuates grain.  \n   \u2022 Need maximum chemical/abrasion resistance with fewer coats.  \n   \u2022 Don\u2019t mind a longer dry/cure time or stronger odor.  \n   \u2022 Are finishing hardwood floors, rustic furniture, tabletops or bar tops.\n\nTip from the Zava toolbox  \nFor large floor jobs where you like the look of oil but not the long downtime, a hybrid approach works: one sealer coat of oil-based for color, then two fast topcoats of a compatible water-based polyurethane 24 hrs later. Always do a small test panel first to verify adhesion.\n\nApplication essentials  \n   1. Stir, never shake, to avoid bubbles.  \n   2. Use a high-quality synthetic bristle or microfiber roller for water-based; natural bristle or foam/synthetic blend for oil-based.  \n   3. Maintain a wet edge and work with the grain.  \n   4. Lightly scuff-sand (220\u2013320-grit) between coats and tack-cloth clean.\n\nHave more questions, or need help picking the right finish for your project? Just ask\u2014Zava\u2019s here to help."}]}

Here\u2019s a step-by-step guide you can follow with common tools and materials from a DIY hardware store like Zava:\n\n1. Clear and protect the area  \n   \u2022 Move furniture away from walls or out of the room if possible.  \n   \u2022 Lay down drop cloths or plastic sheeting to protect floors.  \n   \u2022 Remove or loosen switch plates, outlet covers, curtain hardware, nails, and picture hangers.  \n   \u2022 Mask trim, baseboards, and windows with painter\u2019s tape.\n\n2. Clean the surface  \n   \u2022 Dust first: Wipe walls with a microfiber cloth or use a vacuum with a brush attachment.  \n   \u2022 Degrease: In kitchens, bathrooms, or around light switches, wash with a mild solution of water and dish soap or a dedicated wall cleaner (e.g., TSP substitute). Rinse with clean water and let dry.  \n   \u2022 Address mildew: Spot-treat mildew with a 3:1 water-to-bleach solution (wear gloves/eye protection and ensure ventilation).\n\n3. Repair imperfections  \n   \u2022 Fill nail holes and small dents with spackle or lightweight joint compound.  \n   \u2022 For larger holes or cracks, use a patch kit or joint compound with a mesh patch.  \n   \u2022 Let each repair dry fully (check the product\u2019s label), then sand flush with 120- to 150-grit sandpaper.\n\n4. Sand and smooth  \n   \u2022 Lightly sand glossy or rough areas to create a \u201ctooth\u201d for the new paint.  \n   \u2022 Feather the edges around patched spots so they blend in.  \n   \u2022 Remove dust with a damp cloth or tack cloth; walls must be dust-free before priming.\n\n5. Address stains (optional but recommended)  \n   \u2022 Water, smoke, or marker stains can bleed through paint. Spot-prime or seal them with a stain-blocking primer.\n\n6. Prime (crucial in many cases)  \n   \u2022 Always prime bare drywall, patched areas, or walls transitioning from dark-to-light colors.  \n   \u2022 For glossy surfaces (lacquered trim, semi-gloss enamel), use a bonding primer.  \n   \u2022 Roll and brush primer evenly; allow full dry time.\n\n7. Final checks  \n   \u2022 Inspect walls for missed dents or rough spots. Touch up, sand, and re-prime if needed.  \n   \u2022 Ensure the room is well-ventilated and at the temperature recommended on your paint can (usually 50\u201390 \u00b0F or 10\u201332 \u00b0C).\n\n8. Gather paint supplies  \n   \u2022 Quality roller covers and brushes matched to your paint (e.g., 3/8\" nap for smooth walls).  \n   \u2022 Paint tray, extension pole, and a 5-in-1 tool or putty knife.  \n   \u2022 Paint key or opener, stir sticks, and a clean, damp cloth for drips.\n\nWith these steps complete, your walls are ready for the first coat of paint. Proper prep minimizes flashing (uneven sheen), promotes adhesion, and gives you the smooth, professional finish you\u2019re after. Happy painting!"}]}
