Pick the one that suits your skill level and schedule.\n\n1. Prep the space  \n \u2022 Turn off water, drain and disconnect the toilet (if you choose removal).  \n \u2022 Lay down a drop cloth or old sheet around the base to catch drips.  \n \u2022 Use painter\u2019s tape to mask off the floor and wall-floor joint, and around flange bolts if you\u2019re not removing the toilet.  \n \u2022 Clean the wall with a mild trisodium phosphate (TSP)\u2013based cleaner or a good all-purpose bathroom cleaner to remove dust, mildew and soap scum. Rinse and let dry completely.\n\n2A. Best finish: Remove the toilet  \n Pros: Full, even coverage; no awkward cutting-in.  \n Steps:  \n  a. Shut off the supply, flush, sponge out the bowl and tank; unbolt and lift off the toilet.  \n  b. Patch any gouges or nail holes with a ready-mixed spackle. Sand smooth.  \n  c. Prime bare drywall or patched areas with a stain-blocking primer.  \n  d. Roll or brush on two thin coats of your chosen bathroom-rated paint (eggshell or satin finish). Allow proper dry times.  \n  e. Reinstall the toilet using a new wax ring.\n\n2B. Paint without removal (in-place technique)  \n Tools you\u2019ll need:  \n  \u2022 2\u2033 angled sash brush (for \u201ccut-in\u201d around curves)  \n  \u2022 Mini roller (4\u2033 nap roller cover)  \n  \u2022 Roller extension or telescoping pole  \n  \u2022 Paint pan or bucket  \n  \u2022 Good LED work light (to see shadows and catch any missed spots)\n\n Steps:  \n  a. Mask: Run painter\u2019s tape a few millimeters above the floor-board joint and around the bolt caps at the toilet base.  \n  b. Cut-in: Load your angled brush lightly and \u201ccut\u201d a neat line along the top of the baseboard and where the tile or wall meets the tank. Work in small sections so the edges stay wet.  \n  c. Roll: Pour paint into your pan or bucket. Slip the mini roller onto the extension pole, then roll vertically in light, even strokes behind the toilet. Tilt the pole at an angle so the nap makes good contact behind the bowl.  \n  d. Back-Brush (optional): While the paint is still wet, lightly drag the dry angled brush through the wet roller lines to even out texture.  \n  e. Second coat: After the first coat dries per manufacturer\u2019s instructions, repeat cutting-in and rolling for full coverage.\n\nFinal touches  \n \u2022 Remove tape carefully before the last coat fully hardens to avoid peeling.  \n \u2022 Ventilate well\u2014keep the fan on and windows open.  \n \u2022 Replace bolt caps and reinstall any fixtures you removed.  \n\nWith either method, using a high-quality water-based, mildew-resistant bathroom paint and keeping your coats light and even will give you a durable, attractive finish\u2014even in that hard-to-reach spot behind the throne."}]}

Paint Type & Finish  \n   \u2022 Water-based (acrylic/latex) enamel \u2013 low odour, fast-drying, no yellowing.  \n   \u2022 Finish: Satin or low-lustre eggshell \u2013 smooth enough to wipe clean, but not so glossy that wall imperfections stand out.  \n\n2. Key Features  \n   \u2022 Washability & scrub resistance \u2013 look for paints rated for frequent cleaning.  \n   \u2022 Mildew/mould inhibitors \u2013 vital for steam- and grease-prone areas.  \n   \u2022 Stain-blocking primer included or compatible primer available.  \n\n3. Preparation & Application Tips  \n   \u2022 Clean walls thoroughly to remove grease and cooking residues; a mild sugar-soap or trisodium phosphate wash works well.  \n   \u2022 Repair any holes/cracks, sand smooth and dust off.  \n   \u2022 Prime bare or patched areas with a stain-blocking primer (e.g. Zava Kitchen Prime\u2122 or equivalent).  \n   \u2022 Apply two coats of finish paint, allowing proper drying time between coats.  \n\n4.

Remove doors, drawers & hardware  \n   \u2022 Label each door/drawer and its corresponding hinge location.  \n   \u2022 Take off knobs, pulls and hinges. Keep all screws in small labeled containers.  \n   \u2022 Lay doors and drawer fronts flat on sawhorses or a protected work surface.\n\n3. Clean and degrease  \n   \u2022 Wipe every surface thoroughly with your degreasing cleaner.  \n   \u2022 Rinse with clean water and let fully dry\u2014any residue will show through paint.\n\n4. Fill and sand  \n   \u2022 Inspect for scratches, dents or old filler. Apply fresh wood or plastic-compatible filler as needed; let cure.  \n   \u2022 Sand all cabinet faces and frames with 120-grit to knock down the existing finish.  \n   \u2022 Follow with 220-grit for a smooth surface.  \n   \u2022 After sanding, remove dust with tack cloth or a vacuum. A clean surface is critical for adhesion.\n\n5. Prime  \n   \u2022 Apply a thin, even coat of primer, focusing on bare wood, filler spots and any stained areas.  \n   \u2022 If you\u2019re using a sprayer, overlap passes by about 50%. If brushing, maintain a wet edge to avoid lap marks.  \n   \u2022 Let primer dry per manufacturer instructions. Lightly scuff with 220-grit if surfaces feel \u201cfuzzy,\u201d then dust off.\n\n6. Paint  \n   \u2022 Stir or mix paint thoroughly. Avoid shaking (to reduce bubbles).  \n   \u2022 For brush/roller: use a quality angled sash brush for corners and a short-nap foam roller for flat panels. Work panel by panel, maintaining a wet edge.  \n   \u2022 For spraying: thin paint as directed (usually with water for water-based or mineral spirits for alkyd) and back-roll to ensure full coverage without drips.  \n   \u2022 Apply two thin coats rather than one heavy coat\u2014this reduces drips and levels out brush marks.  \n   \u2022 Allow proper dry time between coats (check label\u2014often 2\u20134 hours).\n\n7. Reassemble  \n   \u2022 After the final coat is fully cured (often 24\u201348 hours, up to a week for heavy use), reattach hinges, knobs and pulls.  \n   \u2022 Hang doors and slide drawers back in place, making minor hinge adjustments as needed.\n\n8. Final tips  \n   \u2022 Work in a well-ventilated area at moderate temperature (ideally 18\u201324 \u00b0C).  \n   \u2022 If possible, remove cabinet frames from the kitchen and paint them separately.  \n   \u2022 Use painter\u2019s pyramids or sticks to elevate doors, allowing access to edges without touching wet paint.  \n   \u2022 Keep pets and dust sources away until paint fully cures.\n\nFollowing these steps will give your kitchen cabinets a professional-grade finish that stands up to everyday use.

Prepare your workspace  \n   \u2022 Lay down drop cloths or plastic sheeting to protect floors and furniture.  \n   \u2022 Remove outlet and switch-plate covers.  \n   \u2022 Wear safety goggles, a dust mask and gloves.\n\n2. Clean the wall  \n   \u2022 Dust off loose debris and cobwebs with a soft-bristle brush or vacuum attachment.  \n   \u2022 Wipe the surface with a mild detergent solution (one part household cleaner to ten parts water), then rinse with clean water.  \n   \u2022 Allow the wall to dry completely.\n\n3. Repair any damage  \n   \u2022 Fill cracks or holes with a lightweight filler or joint compound, using a putty knife.  \n   \u2022 For deep indentations, apply in layers, letting each layer dry before adding the next.  \n   \u2022 Once dry, lightly sand only the repaired spots to blend them into the texture\u2014avoid over-sanding the surrounding texture.\n\n4. (Optional) Smooth out extreme texture  \n   \u2022 If the texture is too pronounced, consider a skim coat of joint compound:  \n     \u2013 Apply a thin, even layer with a wide drywall knife or trowel.  \n     \u2013 Let it set just enough to be firm but still workable, then \u201cknock down\u201d the peaks with a broad knife to create a gentler texture.  \n     \u2013 Allow to dry fully, then lightly sand with fine-grit paper to remove high spots.  \n   \u2022 Alternatively, install a pre-pasted wall liner (wallpaper liner) to create a smoother base.\n\n5. Prime the surface  \n   \u2022 Use a high-build, bonding primer or an acrylic masonry primer formulated for rough/textured surfaces.  \n   \u2022 Apply with a thick-nap roller (9\u201312 mm nap) or an airless sprayer for best coverage in crevices.  \n   \u2022 Let the primer dry according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions.\n\n6. Choose the right paint and tools  \n   \u2022 Select a high-quality acrylic or latex interior paint\u2014flat or eggshell hides imperfections best; satin or semi-gloss is more washable but highlights texture.  \n   \u2022 Use a roller with a 12\u201318 mm (\u00bd\"\u2013\u00be\") nap to reach into the texture\u2019s recesses.  \n   \u2022 Keep an angled brush on hand for cutting in along edges, corners and around fixtures.\n\n7.

Base-coat and drying  \n   \u2022 Paint the background/base color first and let it cure fully (follow the paint maker\u2019s drying time).  \n   \u2022 A fully cured base helps seal the paper tape and prevents seepage.\n\n3. Use quality painter\u2019s tape  \n   \u2022 Invest in a low-tack tape designed for delicate surfaces (e.g. \u201cFrogTape Delicate Surface\u201d or similar).  \n   \u2022 Apply tape straight and press down firmly along the edges (use a plastic scraper or the flat side of a putty knife).\n\n4.

Tape removal  \n   \u2022 Peel the tape off at a 45\u00b0 angle while the stripe coat is still slightly tacky or just dry to the touch.  \n   \u2022 Pull back slowly and evenly to avoid lifting the paint film.\n\n7. Optional extras  \n   \u2022 For very tight or high-contrast stripes, consider running a thin bead of paintable caulk under the tape for an extra seal.  \n   \u2022 Liquid masking films (masking \u201cliquid frisket\u201d) can also create razor-sharp edges on small stencil details.\n\nFollowing these steps will help you achieve sharp, professional-looking stripes without color bleed.

Prime (if needed)  \n   \u2022 If you\u2019re painting over dark colors, stains, or patched areas, apply a coat of high-quality primer.  \n   \u2022 Let the primer dry according to manufacturer instructions (typically 2\u20134 hours).  \n\n5. Choose the right paint and finish  \n   \u2022 Use a washable, durable latex paint formulated for high-traffic areas.  \n   \u2022 Satin or semi-gloss finishes are best\u2014they\u2019re easier to clean and resist scuffs better than flat or eggshell.  \n\n6. Paint the walls  \n   a. \u201cCut in\u201d around edges first:  \n      \u2013 Use your angled sash brush to paint a 2\u20133\u2033 border along the ceiling line, corners, door frames, and baseboards.  \n   b. Roll the field:  \n      \u2013 Pour paint into your tray and load your roller evenly.  \n      \u2013 Work in 3\u20134 foot sections, rolling in a \u201cW\u201d or \u201cM\u201d pattern, then fill in.  \n      \u2013 Maintain a wet edge to avoid lap marks.  \n   c. Apply at least 2 coats:  \n      \u2013 Allow the first coat to dry fully (check can for recoat time).  \n      \u2013 Lightly inspect for thin spots or roller marks, then apply a second coat.  \n\n7. Inspect and touch up  \n   \u2022 After the final coat dries, remove the painter\u2019s tape at a 45\u00b0 angle.  \n   \u2022 Touch up any areas as needed with your sash brush.  \n\n8. Clean up and reassemble  \n   \u2022 Clean brushes, rollers, and trays with warm, soapy water.  \n   \u2022 Re-install outlet/switch covers and hardware.  \n   \u2022 Return furniture and d\u00e9cor once paint is fully cured (usually 24\u201348 hours).  \n\n9. Optional protective topcoat  \n   \u2022 For extremely high-traffic hallways (kids\u2019 areas, busy apartments), you can apply a clear, water-based acrylic topcoat. This adds extra scuff resistance and makes cleaning even easier.  \n\nTips for success  \n   \u2022 Keep the room well-ventilated while painting and drying.  \n   \u2022 Work with consistent lighting so you can spot thin areas.  \n   \u2022 Invest in good-quality tools\u2014better rollers and brushes give a smoother, more even finish.  \n\nWith proper prep, the right paint, and two smooth coats, your hallway walls will look fresh and stand up to daily wear for years to come.

Prepare the Surface  \n \u2022 Clear the room of furniture or move items to the center and cover with drop cloths.  \n \u2022 Dust and vacuum the walls thoroughly\u2014texture traps dust, spider webs and grit.  \n \u2022 For greasy or stained areas, wash with a mild detergent or TSP substitute, rinse and let dry.  \n \u2022 Patch any holes or cracks with spackle or joint compound. Let dry, then lightly sand smooth.\n\n2. Mask and Protect  \n \u2022 Apply painter\u2019s tape around trim, windows, door frames and baseboards.  \n \u2022 Lay down drop cloths to catch drips and spills.\n\n3. Prime (Highly Recommended)  \n \u2022 Textured surfaces can be more porous and uneven. A quality acrylic or stain-blocking primer will ensure uniform adhesion and color.  \n \u2022 Use a roller with a thick nap (\u00bc\u201d\u2013\u00bd\u201d for light textures, \u00be\u201d\u20131\u00bc\u201d for heavy textures) or an airless sprayer for best coverage.  \n \u2022 Allow the primer to dry fully according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions.\n\n4. Choose the Right Tools and Paint  \n \u2022 Roller: use a high-nap (\u00be\u201d to 1\u00bc\u201d) roller cover designed for textured surfaces. It holds more paint and pushes it into crevices.  \n \u2022 Sprayer: an airless paint sprayer or HVLP sprayer can give the most even coat, but you\u2019ll still need to back-roll to work paint into the deepest recesses.  \n \u2022 Brush: a quality angled trim brush for \u201ccutting in\u201d edges and corners.  \n \u2022 Paint: 100 % acrylic or acrylic-latex interior paint in eggshell, satin or matte finish. Matte hides shadows best on uneven surfaces; satin is more washable.\n\n5. Cutting In  \n \u2022 Start by \u201ccutting in\u201d around the ceiling line, corners and trim with a brush\u2014extend about 3\u20134 inches into the wall.\n\n6. Rolling or Spraying  \n If rolling:  \n  \u2022 Load the roller generously.  \n  \u2022 Roll in a W- or M-pattern, working in small sections, then fill in without lifting the roller.  \n  \u2022 Maintain a \u201cwet edge\u201d to avoid lap marks.  \n  \u2022 Go back over each section with light, even strokes to ensure paint is worked into all nooks.  \n If spraying:  \n  \u2022 Follow the sprayer manufacturer\u2019s settings for interior latex paints.  \n  \u2022 Hold the gun 10\u201312\u2033 from the wall, move evenly side to side, overlapping passes by about 30%.  \n  \u2022 Back-roll immediately after spraying to even out texture coverage.\n\n7. Apply a Second Coat  \n \u2022 Most textured walls will need at least two coats for full, uniform coverage.  \n \u2022 Allow recommended dry time between coats (usually 4\u20136 hours).\n\n8. Clean Up  \n \u2022 Remove painter\u2019s tape before paint fully cures to avoid peeling.  \n \u2022 Clean brushes, rollers and sprayer parts with warm soapy water (for latex paint).\n\n9. Final Touches  \n \u2022 Inspect under good lighting for any missed spots or thin areas\u2014you may need a touch-up.  \n \u2022 Replace outlet covers, switch plates and move furniture back once paint is fully cured (usually 24\u201348 hours).\n\nTips  \n \u2022 Work from top to bottom so drips land on unpainted areas you\u2019ll cover anyway.  \n \u2022 For very heavy textures (stucco, knockdown): consider specialty rollers or professional spraying.  \n \u2022 Keep a small artist\u2019s brush handy for hard-to-reach crevices.  \n\nFollowing these steps will help you achieve an even, professional-looking finish on any textured wall surface.

Choose the Right Paint  \n   \u2022 Select a zero- or low-VOC (volatile organic compound) paint labeled \u201cGreen Seal,\u201d \u201cGREENGUARD,\u201d or specifically formulated for children\u2019s rooms.  \n   \u2022 Avoid paints with added biocides or fungicides.\n\n2. Plan and Prepare  \n   \u2022 Remove or seal off furniture, carpets and toys. Use drop cloths or plastic sheeting.  \n   \u2022 Clean walls thoroughly\u2014dust, dirt and grease can affect paint adhesion. A gentle sugar-soap solution works well.  \n   \u2022 Repair any holes or cracks with a non-toxic spackling compound. Sand smooth once dry.\n\n3. Ensure Proper Ventilation  \n   \u2022 Open windows and, if possible, doors to create cross-ventilation.  \n   \u2022 Use a small fan set to \u201cexhaust\u201d mode pointed out a window to pull fumes outside.  \n   \u2022 Keep the room well-ventilated during painting and for at least 24\u201348 hours after finishing.\n\n4. Use Safe Equipment and PPE  \n   \u2022 Wear disposable gloves and a protective mask rated for paint fumes (an N95 mask helps block particulates).  \n   \u2022 Goggles or safety glasses protect your eyes from splashes.  \n   \u2022 Use ladder or step stool safely\u2014always face the ladder, keep three points of contact.\n\n5. Apply Paint Carefully  \n   \u2022 Start with a quality primer if you\u2019re covering dark colors or achieving a very light pastel. Look for a low-VOC primer.  \n   \u2022 Roll or brush paint in thin, even coats. Thick coats take longer to dry and off-gas more.  \n   \u2022 Let each coat dry fully (check the manufacturer\u2019s timing) before adding the next.\n\n6. Minimize Odors and Off-Gassing  \n   \u2022 Keep the room ventilated until the walls feel \u201codor-free\u201d (often 24\u201348 hours).  \n   \u2022 Avoid using the nursery for at least 72 hours after the final coat to let any remaining fumes dissipate.\n\n7. Clean Up and Dispose  \n   \u2022 Wipe brushes and rollers in a utility sink; use water for latex paint or mineral spirits for oil-based.  \n   \u2022 Seal leftover paint cans tightly and store in a cool location out of reach of children.  \n   \u2022 Dispose of used drop cloths or plastic sheeting according to local waste regulations if contaminated.\n\n8. Final Checks Before Use  \n   \u2022 Once dry and no odors remain, thoroughly clean the floor and wipe down window sills and ledges.  \n   \u2022 Bring furniture and toys back in\u2014but keep windows open or a small fan running for another few hours if possible.\n\nBy choosing non-toxic materials, ensuring good airflow, and keeping your little one out of the room until everything is fully cured and odor-free, you\u2019ll create a beautifully painted nursery that\u2019s safe and healthy."}]}

Bear in mind that stripping the paper and starting on bare drywall is almost always the more durable solution\u2014paint on paper is prone to peeling in high-moisture areas. But if removal isn\u2019t an option, this will give you the best chance of success:\n\n1. Inspect the wallpaper  \n   \u2022 Make sure all sheets are firmly stuck and there are no loose edges or bubbling. Any loose paper will become more obvious once you paint.  \n   \u2022 If you find any loose seams, carefully re\u2010adhere them with a clear wallpaper adhesive.\n\n2. Clean thoroughly  \n   \u2022 Bathrooms accumulate soap scum, mold and mildew. Clean the walls with a mildew-killing cleaner or a TSP substitute.  \n   \u2022 Rinse well and let the walls dry completely (24\u201348 hours if possible).\n\n3. Fill seams and smooth joints  \n   \u2022 Use a mold-resistant acrylic caulk to seal any small gaps between sheets and along trim\u2014this keeps moisture from getting behind the paper.  \n   \u2022 Lightly sand any high seams or embossed patterns so the surface is as flat as possible. Wipe off the dust.\n\n4. Apply a high-adhesion primer/sealer  \n   \u2022 Choose an oil-based or shellac-based primer, or a specialty vinyl-leggings primer. These seal the paper and prevent \u201cshadows\u201d or yellowing from bleeding through your finish coats.  \n   \u2022 Follow the manufacturer\u2019s instructions for drying time. Two coats are better than one\u2014make sure you\u2019ve got full coverage.\n\n5. Paint with a bathroom-grade finish  \n   \u2022 Select a 100% acrylic or acrylic-latex paint formulated for high-humidity areas (often labeled \u201cbathroom\u201d or \u201cmildew-resistant\u201d).  \n   \u2022 A satin or semi-gloss sheen is best, since it tolerates moisture and cleans easily.  \n   \u2022 Apply two thin, even coats, allowing proper dry time between coats (usually 4\u20136 hours).\n\n6.

Preparation  \n \u2022 Clean the surface: Remove dust, cobwebs and any loose paint.  \n \u2022 Repair imperfections: Fill cracks or holes with spackling, sand smooth, then wipe away dust.  \n \u2022 Prime if needed: Use a ceiling or multipurpose primer, especially on new drywall or patched areas.\n\n2. Choose the right tools  \n \u2022 Roller cover nap: For a smooth ceiling, use a 3\u20448\u2033\u20131\u20442\u2033 (10\u201313 mm) nap roller. It holds enough paint but doesn\u2019t leave heavy stipple.  \n \u2022 Quality roller: A good-quality, lint-free microfiber or woven cover will lay off more evenly.  \n \u2022 Extension pole: Keeps a consistent roller angle and reduces fatigue.  \n \u2022 Angled trim brush or small edging tool: For cutting in around walls, lights and vents.\n\n3. Select the right paint and additives  \n \u2022 Flat or matte ceiling paint: Flat formulations hide imperfections better than eggshell or semi-gloss.  \n \u2022 Add a paint conditioner: Products like Floetrol (for water-based paints) improve flow and eliminate brush/roller marks.\n\n4. Roller technique  \n \u2022 Load properly: Dip the roller and roll it in the tray until it\u2019s fully saturated but not dripping.  \n \u2022 \u201cW\u201d or \u201cM\u201d pattern: On a 3\u20134 ft square section, roll a loose \u201cW\u201d or \u201cM,\u201d then fill in without lifting the roller.  \n \u2022 Maintain a wet edge: Work quickly in small sections so you\u2019re always blending new paint into wet paint.  \n \u2022 Light, even pressure: Too much pressure squeezes paint out unevenly and accentuates texture. Let the roller\u2019s weight do the work.  \n \u2022 Cross-roll: After laying your \u201cW\u201d pattern, roll lightly in perpendicular (or random) directions to knock down any lines.\n\n5. Work methodically  \n \u2022 Divide the ceiling into manageable zones (about 4 \u00d7 4 ft).  \n \u2022 Finish each zone before moving on, always overlapping about 2\u20133 inches onto the previously painted area.  \n \u2022 Backroll across seams or edges while the paint is still wet.\n\n6. Second coat  \n \u2022 Allow full dry time (check manufacturer\u2019s instructions).  \n \u2022 Repeat the same roller technique\u2014this coat further levels out any remaining inconsistencies.\n\n7. Optional: Airless sprayer  \n \u2022 For large ceilings, an airless sprayer can give the flattest finish and fastest coverage. Mask walls, floors and fixtures carefully before spraying.\n\nFinal tips  \n \u2022 Keep the room well-lit so you can spot missed areas or roller tracks as you go.  \n \u2022 Work in one direction across the room (e.g. along the long axis) to keep your orientation and wet-edge consistent.  \n \u2022 Clean and maintain your roller cover between coats (rinse, spin out excess water or solvent, then wrap in plastic if you need to pause).\n\nBy combining the right tools, paint and technique\u2014properly loading your roller, working in small sections, and maintaining a wet edge\u2014you\u2019ll end up with a ceiling free of unsightly roller marks."}]}

Take your time on each step\u2014proper prep and the right products are the keys to a durable, smooth finish.  \n\n1. Safety and Preparation  \n\u2022 Work in a well-ventilated space. Open windows or run a fan.  \n\u2022 Wear nitrile gloves, safety goggles, and a respirator rated for paint fumes (organic vapors).  \n\u2022 Remove everything from the bathroom if possible (shower curtain, mats, toiletries).  \n\u2022 Turn off the water supply to the tub faucets and remove hardware (drain strainer, overflow plate, faucet handles).  \n\n2. Clean and Degrease  \n\u2022 Mix a strong cleaner or use trisodium phosphate (TSP) according to label directions.  \n\u2022 Scrub the entire tub surface\u2014bottom, sides, front apron\u2014with a non-scratching scrub pad or sponge.  \n\u2022 Rinse thoroughly with clean water and let dry completely (at least 1\u20132 hours, depending on humidity).  \n\n3. Sand the Surface  \n\u2022 Lightly sand all fiberglass surfaces with 220-grit sandpaper (hand-held sanding block or an orbital sander on low speed). This removes the glossy factory gel-coat and gives your primer something to bite into.  \n\u2022 Pay special attention to areas with minor scratches or etching; feather them out.  \n\u2022 After sanding, wipe away dust with a tack cloth or a lint-free rag dampened with denatured alcohol. Allow to dry.  \n\n4. Mask Off Surroundings  \n\u2022 Use quality painter\u2019s tape to protect tile walls, fixtures, faucets, drains, and overflow.  \n\u2022 Lay down drop cloths or plastic sheeting on the floor.  \n\n5. Apply a Fiberglass-Compatible Primer  \n\u2022 Choose an epoxy-based or bonding primer labeled for fiberglass or gel-coat repair. Two-part epoxy primers are common.  \n\u2022 Mix the primer components exactly per the manufacturer\u2019s instructions.  \n\u2022 Using a high-density foam roller (and angled foam brush for corners), apply a thin, even coat. Avoid drips and sags.  \n\u2022 Let primer flash off (usually 1\u20132 hours). If the manufacturer calls for light sanding between coats, use 320\u2013400 grit and re-tack cloth.  \n\u2022 Apply a second primer coat if recommended.  \n\n6. Paint with a Durable Topcoat  \nOption A: Brush/Roller Two-Part Epoxy Paint  \n Option B: Aerosol Acrylic Urethane Enamel  \n\u2022 Follow the manufacturer\u2019s mixing ratios and pot-life guidelines.  \n\u2022 Apply 2\u20133 thin, even coats rather than one heavy coat.  \n\u2022 Wait the recommended flash time between coats (often 30\u201360 minutes).  \n\u2022 Maintain a \u201cwet edge\u201d to avoid lap marks.  \n\n7. Cure Time  \n\u2022 After the final coat, allow the tub to cure fully before using. Curing varies by product\u2014typically 24\u201372 hours for light use, and up to 7 days for full chemical/water resistance.  \n\u2022 Keep the bathroom well-ventilated until odors dissipate.  \n\n8. Reassemble and Care  \n\u2022 Remove tape and masking materials carefully.  \n\u2022 Reinstall drain hardware, overflow plate, faucets.  \n\u2022 Clean gently for the first week\u2014avoid abrasive scrubbing pads. Use mild, non-acidic cleaners.  \n\nTips and Troubleshooting  \n\u2022 Humidity below 50% and room temperature of 65\u201375\u00b0F yield best results.  \n\u2022 If you see runs or drips, sand them smooth with 400\u2013600 grit before the next coat.  \n\u2022 Always follow the specific technical data sheets of the primer and paint you purchase.  \n\nBy giving proper attention to cleaning, sanding, priming, and curing, your refurbished fiberglass tub can look factory-fresh and last for years. Good luck with your project!"}]}

Tint Your Primer Grey  \n   \u2022 A mid-tone grey primer can cut your top-coat effort roughly in half when covering very dark walls.  \n   \u2022 Many big-box stores and paint shops will tint 1-2-3\u00ae or KILZ\u00ae Premium to a neutral grey.\n\n4. Application Tips  \n   \u2022 Prepare the surface: remove flaking paint, sand gloss finishes lightly, clean off dust and grease.  \n   \u2022 Apply 1\u20132 coats of primer, allowing proper flash-off time between coats.  \n   \u2022 Lightly sand between coats for super-smooth results, then finish with your top-coat.\n\nIn most DIY scenarios, if you don\u2019t need shellac\u2019s smell or raw chemical strength, you\u2019ll get a great balance of performance and convenience with a grey-tinted Zinsser Bulls Eye 1-2-3 or KILZ Premium.

Spot-prime any bare or repaired areas  \n   \u2022 If your sanding exposed wood, filler or drywall, prime those bare spots first with an oil-based or shellac-based primer.  \n   \u2022 Follow manufacturer\u2019s drying times.  \n\n5. Prime the entire surface  \n   \u2022 Use a quality bonding or adhesion-promoting primer formulated for glossy or oil-based surfaces.  \n     \u2013 Examples: Zinsser Bulls Eye 1-2-3, Zinsser BIN shellac primer, or an oil-based alkyd primer.  \n   \u2022 Apply with a brush or roller in even strokes.  \n   \u2022 Let the primer cure fully (check label, typically 2\u20134 hours for water-based primers, longer for oil-based).  \n\n6. Apply the topcoat  \n   \u2022 Choose your desired finish (latex or oil-based paint). Modern water-based (acrylic/latex) topcoats are fine once you\u2019ve used the proper primer.  \n   \u2022 Stir paint gently\u2014don\u2019t shake, to avoid bubbles.  \n   \u2022 Cut in edges with a quality angled brush, then roll the larger areas with a short-nap roller.  \n   \u2022 Apply at least two thin, even coats rather than one heavy coat.  \n   \u2022 Follow manufacturer\u2019s dry and recoat times between coats (typically 4\u20136 hours for water-based paints).  \n\n7.

Sand or Abrade the Metal  \n   \u2022 Use 120\u2013220-grit sandpaper or a Scotch-Brite pad to remove loose paint and lightly scuff the existing finish.  \n   \u2022 Your goal is a dull, slightly rough surface so new primer and paint will \u201cbite.\u201d  \n   \u2022 Wipe off sanding dust with a tack cloth or a clean, dry microfiber towel.\n\n4. Mask the Glass and Surroundings  \n   \u2022 Use good-quality painter\u2019s tape plus thin plastic sheeting or craft paper to cover the glass, tile, walls and floor.  \n   \u2022 Press the tape edge firmly so paint won\u2019t bleed under it.\n\n5. Apply a Metal-Specific Primer  \n   \u2022 For steel: use a rust-inhibiting, self-etching primer.  \n   \u2022 For aluminum: choose a primer labeled for aluminum or an all-surface self-etching primer.  \n   \u2022 Shake or stir thoroughly. Spray or brush on 1\u20132 thin, even coats according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions.  \n   \u2022 Allow recommended flash-off/dry time between coats.\n\n6. Lightly Sand Between Coats (Optional)  \n   \u2022 Once the primer is dry, give it a light scuff with 320\u2013400-grit sandpaper to knock down any grain or dust nibs.  \n   \u2022 Wipe clean with a tack cloth.\n\n7. Apply the Topcoat  \n   \u2022 Use a high-build enamel or epoxy spray paint formulated for metal bathroom fixtures. (Rust-Oleum Universal or similar brands work well.)  \n   \u2022 Shake the can (or mix paint) thoroughly.  \n   \u2022 Hold the spray 8\u201312\" from the frame and apply in smooth, overlapping passes. Two to three thin coats are better than one heavy coat.  \n   \u2022 Watch for drips and runs\u2014if you see any, back off and let the paint flow out before doing a second pass.\n\n8. Cure and Reassemble  \n   \u2022 Let the painted frame cure fully\u2014check the can for recoat and full-cure times (often 24\u201348 hours).  \n   \u2022 Remove masking, reinstall hardware and hang the door back on its track.  \n   \u2022 Avoid wiping or cleaning the frame aggressively for several days to let the finish harden.\n\nTips for Success  \n \u2022 Work in a well-ventilated area and wear a respirator rated for paint fumes.  \n \u2022 Maintain a consistent temperature (60\u201380\u00b0F) and low humidity if possible\u2014high humidity can cause \u201corange peel\u201d or slow drying.  \n \u2022 If brushing instead of spraying, choose a high-quality synthetic brush and apply thin coats to minimize brush strokes.  \n\nFollowing these steps will give your shower door frame  \na smooth, durable finish that stands up to moisture and daily use."}]}

Gather your materials and tools  \n   \u2022 Paint (one for walls, one for ceilings if you\u2019re doing different colors or finishes)  \n   \u2022 Primer (if you\u2019re covering stains, drastic color changes, or new drywall)  \n   \u2022 Paint trays and liners  \n   \u2022 Quality angled sash brush (2\u2033\u20132\u00bd\u2033) for cutting in  \n   \u2022 Smooth-nap roller cover (\u215c\u2033\u2013\u00bd\u2033 nap) for ceilings and slopes  \n   \u2022 Roller frame and extension pole  \n   \u2022 Painter\u2019s tape (front-edge release tapes work best)  \n   \u2022 Drop cloths or paper for floors and furniture  \n   \u2022 Ladder or small scaffold (ensure it\u2019s rated for your weight and height needs)  \n   \u2022 Spackle or joint compound + putty knife (to fill holes or seams)  \n   \u2022 Sandpaper (120\u2013180 grit) and sanding block  \n   \u2022 Mild cleaner (TSP-substitute) and sponge  \n   \u2022 Safety gear: goggles, gloves, dust mask  \n\n2. Prep the room  \n   \u2022 Clear or move furniture to the center and cover with drop cloths.  \n   \u2022 Lay drop cloths or paper on floors and tape down edges.  \n   \u2022 Remove switch plates, outlet covers, curtain rods.  \n   \u2022 Clean walls and ceiling with a mild degreaser if needed.  \n   \u2022 Fill holes, nail pops, or cracks with spackle, let dry, then sand smooth.  \n\n3. Prime (if necessary)  \n   \u2022 Spot-prime patched areas.  \n   \u2022 If you\u2019re going from a dark color to a light one or the drywall is bare, apply a full coat of primer to ensure uniform coverage.  \n\n4. Tape off adjoining surfaces  \n   \u2022 Use painter\u2019s tape along the top of walls where they meet the ceiling or slope.  \n   \u2022 Tape windows, baseboards, door frames\u2014any place you don\u2019t want paint.  \n\n5. \u201cCut in\u201d the edges first  \n   \u2022 Starting with the ceiling plane, load your angled sash brush and paint a smooth line about 2\u20133\u2033 out from each wall or slope transition.  \n   \u2022 When cutting in sloped areas, work from the highest point of the slope toward the low point so gravity doesn\u2019t pull paint downward before it sets.  \n\n6. Roll the ceiling plane  \n   \u2022 Pour paint into a tray, saturate your roller evenly, and roll the flat ceiling in a \u201cW\u201d or \u201cM\u201d pattern to distribute paint.  \n   \u2022 Then fill in the gaps with parallel strokes until the surface is uniform.  \n   \u2022 Maintain a wet edge to avoid lap marks.  \n\n7. Paint the sloped ceilings  \n   \u2022 Extend your roller with a pole to reach high spots without overextending your arm.  \n   \u2022 Work in small sections (4\u2032\u00d74\u2032) moving top-to-bottom\u2014again, maintain a wet edge.  \n   \u2022 If the slope is very steep, consider using a small scaffold platform so you can stand closer and minimize stretching.  \n\n8. Allow proper drying time  \n   \u2022 Check manufacturer\u2019s instructions\u2014typically 2\u20134 hours between coats.  \n   \u2022 Inspect for thin spots or roller marks and touch up as needed.  \n\n9. Apply a second coat  \n   \u2022 Repeat the same sequence: cut in edges, roll the ceiling, then the slopes.  \n   \u2022 Two coats ensure color richness and even sheen.  \n\n10. Clean up and remove tape  \n   \u2022 Remove painter\u2019s tape before the final coat fully dries (usually when it\u2019s tacky, not bone-dry) to avoid peeling.  \n   \u2022 Clean brushes and rollers immediately with warm, soapy water (for latex paint) or mineral spirits (for oil-based).  \n   \u2022 Reinstall outlet covers, switch plates, and hardware once paint is fully cured.  \n\nTips  \n   \u2022 Work from natural light if possible so you can spot missed areas.  \n   \u2022 For dramatic effect, paint sloped ceilings a contrasting shade from the walls.  \n   \u2022 Always ventilate well\u2014keep windows open or use fans to speed drying and reduce fumes.  \n   \u2022 If the slope is very tight or high, consider renting a small rolling scaffold for stability.  \n\nFollowing these steps will help you achieve smooth, professional-looking coverage on both flat and sloped surfaces.

Depending on the look you\u2019re after (hammered-metal, stone-effect, sand-like, non-slip, etc.), here are a few common options you\u2019ll find at most DIY or paint retailers:\n\n1. Rust-Oleum Hammered Metal Spray  \n   \u2022 Finish: subtle pitted, slightly dimpled \u201chammered\u201d look  \n   \u2022 Uses: metal, wood, masonry, plastic, etc.  \n   \u2022 Key points: no primer needed on most clean, rust-free metal; good for repurposed hardware, frames, trim  \n\n2. Rust-Oleum Stone & Texture Sprays  \n   \u2022 Finish: heavier \u201cpebble\u201d or stone-like texture in various colors (sand, granite, pewter, etc.)  \n   \u2022 Uses: planters, furniture, decorative objects, masonry  \n   \u2022 Key points: builds up a real stone feel; excellent for hiding imperfections  \n\n3. V33 (or Valspar) Anti-Slip/Non-Skid Texture Spray  \n   \u2022 Finish: very fine grit\u2014designed for floors, steps, ramps  \n   \u2022 Uses: concrete, wood, metal, painted surfaces  \n   \u2022 Key points: adds traction; often used on stair nosing, outdoor metal grates  \n\n4. MOTIP Splash Hammer Spray  \n   \u2022 Finish: pronounced hammered effect in metallic shades  \n   \u2022 Uses: interior/exterior metal, wood, glass, ceramic  \n   \u2022 Key points: one-step finish; durable top coat  \n\n5. Specialty Art-Supply Sprays (e.g. Liquitex Sand or Fine Boulder)  \n   \u2022 Finish: ultra-fine to coarse art-grade textures  \n   \u2022 Uses: canvas, sculpture, mixed media  \n   \u2022 Key points: better control for small craft or fine-art purposes  \n\nTips for best results  \n\u2022 Surface prep: clean, dry, and degloss glossy surfaces. Lightly sand slick plastics or metals so the texture paint will adhere.  \n\u2022 Primer: although many \u201chammered\u201d and \u201cstone\u201d sprays claim self-priming, priming can improve uniform coverage on bare metal or very smooth substrates.  \n\u2022 Application: shake the can very well (at least 1\u20132 minutes after the mixing ball rattles). Hold 20\u201330 cm (8\u201312 inches) from the surface and apply multiple thin coats rather than one heavy one. This prevents runs and pooling.  \n\u2022 Curing: allow each coat to flash off (5\u201315 min depending on product), then let the final coat cure fully (often 24 hours) before handling or topcoating.  \n\nWith those products you can achieve everything from a light, sparkly \u201chammered\u201d sheen to a heavy stone or anti-slip grit\u2014just pick the finish that suits your project!"}]}

Two-Component (2K) Urethane or Polyaspartic  \n   \u2022 Composition: requires mixing a resin and a hardener on-site  \n   \u2022 Durability: extremely abrasion- and chemical-resistant\u2014commonly used in commercial & industrial settings  \n   \u2022 Cure time: fast (especially polyaspartics), but you must get the mix ratio right  \n   \u2022 Yellowing: low to moderate (polyaspartics yellow far less than oil-based poly)  \n   \u2022 DIY level: advanced\u2014strictly follow manufacturer\u2019s mix, application and ventilation guidelines\n\n2. Acid-Cured (Conversion) Varnish (\u201cSwedish Finish\u201d)  \n   \u2022 Composition: one-component solvent-based, cured by a chemical reaction with moisture in the air  \n   \u2022 Durability: very hard, has long been the pros\u2019 choice in Europe for high-traffic areas  \n   \u2022 Yellowing: high\u2014gives a warm amber glow over time  \n   \u2022 DIY level: professional to advanced; strong solvent odor, requires flawless application\n\n3. Oil-Based Polyurethane (1K)  \n   \u2022 Composition: solvent-borne urethane in a single can  \n   \u2022 Durability: excellent abrasion and moisture resistance for a 1K product  \n   \u2022 Yellowing: moderate to high\u2014adds \u201cwarmth\u201d and amber tones to the wood  \n   \u2022 DIY level: moderate; longer dry times let you self-level, but also attract more dust\n\n4.

Clear and protect the area  \n   \u2022 Remove any furniture or d\u00e9cor that might get in the way.  \n   \u2022 Lay down dust sheets or old sheets to protect floors and nearby surfaces.  \n   \u2022 Use painter\u2019s tape around trim, windows, and door frames.\n\n2. Clean the wallpaper border  \n   \u2022 Lightly wipe the border with a damp sponge or cloth and a mild detergent solution to remove dust, grease or grime.  \n   \u2022 Rinse with a clean damp cloth and let it dry completely (at least a couple of hours).\n\n3. Repair any loose edges or seams  \n   \u2022 Press down any lifting or peeling edges with wallpaper adhesive or a PVA wallpaper seam adhesive.  \n   \u2022 Wipe away excess adhesive and allow to dry according to the product instructions.  \n   \u2022 If there are small tears or gaps, fill them with a lightweight wall filler or spackling. Once dry, sand smooth.\n\n4. Sand the surface  \n   \u2022 Lightly sand the border and the adjoining wallpaper (or wall) with fine-grade sandpaper (120\u2013150 grit).  \n   \u2022 The goal is to dull the glossy finish and create \u201ctooth\u201d for primer and paint to adhere.  \n   \u2022 Wipe off sanding dust with a dry cloth or a damp microfiber cloth, then let dry.\n\n5. Prime the border  \n   \u2022 Use a high-adhesion primer or an acrylic-based wallpaper primer/sealer designed for painting over wallpaper.  \n   \u2022 Apply one even coat with a roller for larger areas and a brush for the edges.  \n   \u2022 Allow the primer to dry fully (check the can for drying times\u2014typically 2\u20134 hours).\n\n6. Inspect and touch up  \n   \u2022 After priming, look closely for any remaining seams, tears or imperfections.  \n   \u2022 Fill and sand those spots again if needed, then spot-prime before proceeding.\n\n7. Paint the border  \n   \u2022 Choose a high-quality acrylic or vinyl-modified emulsion paint in your desired finish (eggshell, satin or semi-gloss tend to be more washable and durable in high-traffic areas).  \n   \u2022 Using a small roller or a trim brush, apply at least two thin coats rather than one thick coat. Let each coat dry fully before applying the next (check paint can for recommended drying time, usually 2\u20134 hours).\n\n8. Remove tape and clean up  \n   \u2022 Peel off painter\u2019s tape before the final coat fully cures, to avoid peeling paint off with the tape.  \n   \u2022 Touch up any areas where paint may have bled or missed.  \n   \u2022 Clean brushes and rollers per manufacturer\u2019s instructions so they last for your next project.\n\nTips and considerations  \n\u2022 If the border pattern is very pronounced or the wallpaper has a heavy texture, removal may be simpler than painting over it\u2014paint will highlight every ridge.  \n\u2022 In humid rooms (bathroom, kitchen), use a mildew-resistant primer and paint.  \n\u2022 Always work in good ventilation and wear a dust mask when sanding strongly textured surfaces.  \n\nFollowing these steps will give you a smooth, long-lasting finish and save you the effort of full wallpaper removal\u2014perfect for a quick update or a rental-friendly refresh!"}]}

Safety first  \n   \u2022 Work in a well-ventilated space\u2014open windows or run an exhaust fan.  \n   \u2022 Wear safety glasses, gloves and a dust mask (especially when sanding or using strong cleaners).\n\n2. Thorough cleaning  \n   \u2022 Remove soap scum, mildew and grease with a heavy-duty cleaner or a trisodium phosphate (TSP) substitute.  \n   \u2022 For mildew: scrub affected areas with a 1:10 bleach-to-water solution (rinse thoroughly afterward).  \n   \u2022 Rinse all surfaces with clean water and allow to dry completely (24 hours if possible).\n\n3. Scuff or lightly sand the tiles  \n   \u2022 Use fine-grit sandpaper (120\u2013220 grit) or a sanding pad to knock down the glossy finish.  \n   \u2022 Focus on creating a uniformly \u201ctooth-y\u201d surface so the primer bonds well.  \n   \u2022 Vacuum or wipe away all dust with a tack cloth; let dry.\n\n4. Mask off surrounding areas  \n   \u2022 Use painter\u2019s tape and drop cloths to protect grout lines you don\u2019t want painted, fixtures, trim and walls.\n\n5. Apply a high-adhesion primer  \n   \u2022 Choose an epoxy-based or specialty tile bonding primer (e.g. Zinsser Bulls-Eye 1-2-3, Rust-Oleum Tile Primer).  \n   \u2022 Follow manufacturer\u2019s mixing and application instructions.  \n   \u2022 Apply one even coat with a foam roller or high-density nap roller; use a brush for edges and corners.  \n   \u2022 Allow primer to cure fully (per label\u2014usually 2\u20134 hours).\n\n6. Paint with a durable, water-resistant coating  \n   \u2022 Use a 100% acrylic enamel or two-part epoxy paint specifically rated for bathrooms or tubs & tiles.  \n   \u2022 Stir thoroughly; apply thin, even coats. Two to three coats are usually needed.  \n   \u2022 Roll on with a fine-nap roller and brush the grout lines and edges.  \n   \u2022 Let each coat dry per manufacturer\u2019s recommendations (usually 4\u20136 hours).\n\n7. Optional clear topcoat (for extra durability)  \n   \u2022 A water-based polyurethane or clear epoxy sealer adds scratch and stain resistance.  \n   \u2022 Apply one thin coat; allow 24 hours to cure.\n\n8. Curing time before use  \n   \u2022 Wait at least 48\u201372 hours before light use; 5\u20137 days for full chemical cure.  \n   \u2022 Keep the room well-ventilated and avoid heavy cleaning during this period.\n\n9. Maintenance tips  \n   \u2022 Clean gently with non-abrasive, pH-neutral cleaners.  \n   \u2022 Avoid harsh scrubbing pads or scouring powders that can scratch the finish.\n\nBy meticulously prepping, using the right primer/paint system, and allowing proper cure time, your refreshed bathroom tiles will look great and stand up to moisture for years to come."}]}

Adjust details slightly depending on indoor vs. outdoor use, but the core process is the same.\n\n1. Inspect and Repair  \n \u2022 Check the brick and mortar for crumbling, cracks or loose pieces.  \n \u2022 Rake out and re-point any failing mortar\u2014fresh mortar gives you a solid, even surface.  \n \u2022 Replace any severely spalled bricks before you paint.\n\n2. Clean Thoroughly  \n \u2022 Exterior brick: use a pressure-washer or stiff-bristled brush with a masonry cleaner (trisodium phosphate, TSP) to lift dirt, mildew and efflorescence (white mineral deposits).  \n \u2022 Interior brick: vacuum loose dust, scrub with mild detergent and warm water, then rinse.  \n \u2022 Allow brick to dry completely\u201424\u201348 hours outside, or at least overnight indoors.\n\n3. Choose the Right Primer  \n \u2022 Use a masonry/bonding primer or an acrylic-latex primer formulated for brick and concrete.  \n \u2022 On very porous or previously unpainted brick you may need two primer coats to seal the surface and prevent uneven sheen.\n\n4. Select Your Paint  \n \u2022 Exterior: choose a 100% acrylic latex masonry paint or elastomeric coating (breathable for freeze-thaw climates).  \n \u2022 Interior: a high-quality acrylic latex paint or masonry interior paint in your chosen finish (eggshell or satin).  \n \u2022 Many masonry paints are self-priming; if so, you can skip a separate primer coat\u2014but make sure the label says \u201cself-priming on bare masonry.\u201d\n\n5. Gather Tools & Safety Gear  \n \u2022 Roller with a \u00be\"\u20131\" nap for rough surfaces (a masonry roller).  \n \u2022 Stiff-bristle masonry brush for edges and mortar joints.  \n \u2022 (Optional) HVLP or airless sprayer for large areas\u2014practice first to avoid drips.  \n \u2022 Gloves, safety goggles, dust mask (especially when cleaning), and good ventilation indoors.\n\n6. Application  \n \u2022 Prime (if needed): work in uniform strokes, starting from the top down. Let primer dry per the manufacturer\u2019s instructions.  \n \u2022 First coat of paint: cut in with brush around edges, then fill large areas with roller or sprayer.  \n \u2022 Second coat: after the first is fully dry (usually 4\u20136 hours), apply a second coat for full, even coverage.  \n \u2022 Inspect for thin spots or mortar lines that absorb more paint; touch up as needed.\n\n7. Finishing Touches & Clean-up  \n \u2022 Remove any paint splatters while still wet with water (latex paint) or solvent (if you used alkyd).  \n \u2022 Clean your brushes, rollers and sprayer per the paint manufacturer\u2019s directions.  \n \u2022 Allow 24\u201348 hours of cure time before heavy use (especially outdoors in damp or cool weather).\n\n8. Maintenance  \n \u2022 Interior brick: dust or vacuum periodically; a damp cloth works for spot-cleaning.  \n \u2022 Exterior brick: wash gently once a year to remove dirt and mildew; touch up any chips or peeling areas.\n\nTips  \n\u2022 Always follow temperature and humidity guidelines on the paint can\u2014painting in too-cold or too-humid conditions can lead to poor adhesion or blistering.  \n\u2022 If you like some of the brick\u2019s natural texture peeking through, consider a tinted translucent masonry stain or sealer instead of full-coverage paint.  \n\u2022 For a quick color refresh without painting, look at breathable brick sealers in tinted or clear finishes.\n\nBring your cleaned, prepped brick surface and any questions to your nearest Zava store; we\u2019ll help you select the perfect primer, paint and tools for a professional-quality finish.

Cleanup and final touches  \n   \u2022 Remove painter\u2019s tape while paint is still slightly wet or just dry to avoid peeling.  \n   \u2022 Touch up any drips or thin spots with a small brush.  \n   \u2022 Clean brushes/rollers with warm, soapy water (for latex paint) or mineral spirits (for oil-based).  \n   \u2022 Reinstall outlet covers, switch plates, and move furniture back once paint is fully cured.  \n\n9. Tips for success  \n   \u2022 Work with plenty of light\u2014use portable work lights if necessary.  \n   \u2022 Pace yourself: painting a cathedral ceiling can be tiring, so take breaks and stay hydrated.  \n   \u2022 Consider a paint additive (like a floetrol for latex) to reduce brush and roller marks for a smoother finish.  \n   \u2022 If you\u2019re uncertain or the ceiling height exceeds 12 ft, renting a small aerial lift can be safer and more efficient than ladders or scaffolding.  \n\nWith good prep, the right tools, and a systematic approach, you\u2019ll have a beautifully painted room\u2014even with those dramatic high ceilings!"}]}

Gather your materials  \n   \u2022 Screwdriver (to remove any hardware)  \n   \u2022 Drop cloths and painter\u2019s tape  \n   \u2022 Cleaner/degreaser or TSP (trisodium phosphate)  \n   \u2022 Fine-to-medium sandpaper (120\u2013150 grit)  \n   \u2022 Tack cloth or a lint-free rag  \n   \u2022 Wood filler (if you have dents or nail holes)  \n   \u2022 Caulk (paintable, acrylic latex)  \n   \u2022 High-adhesion primer (shellac-based or bonding oil-based primer)  \n   \u2022 Paint (good-quality interior enamel in your desired sheen)  \n   \u2022 Brushes (angled sash brush) or mini foam roller  \n\n2. Prep the area  \n   a. Remove or mask off everything adjacent to the trim: light switch plates, outlet covers, window/door hardware.  \n   b. Lay down drop cloths to protect the floor.  \n   c. Apply painter\u2019s tape along the wall and glass edges.\n\n3. Clean the trim  \n   a. Wipe or scrub the stained trim with a degreaser or TSP solution to remove dust, grease, and any existing wax.  \n   b. Rinse with clean water and let it dry thoroughly.\n\n4. Sand lightly  \n   a. Sand the stained surface just enough to dull the gloss and give the primer something to bite into\u2014120\u2013150 grit is ideal.  \n   b. Don\u2019t sand down to bare wood; you just want to remove the shine and rough up the factory finish.  \n   c. Wipe away sanding dust with a tack cloth or a damp, lint-free rag. Let dry.\n\n5. Fill and caulk  \n   a. Fill any nail holes or gouges with wood filler. Let it dry, then sand smooth.  \n   b. Run a thin bead of paintable caulk along joints between the trim and wall or corners. Smooth it with a wet finger or caulking tool, then allow it to cure per manufacturer\u2019s instructions.\n\n6. Prime the trim  \n   a. Choose a stain-blocking primer (shellac-based or an oil-based bonding primer). These seal tannins and prevent bleed-through.  \n   b. Apply one even coat of primer, brushing or rolling in the direction of the wood grain.  \n   c. Let the primer dry fully, then give it a very light sand with 220-grit paper to knock down any raised grain or brush hairs. Wipe off dust.\n\n7. Paint the trim  \n   a. Stir your enamel paint well.  \n   b. Apply first coat with a high-quality angled sash brush or small roller. Paint in long, smooth strokes\u2014start with the top edge, then the flat, then the bottom edge.  \n   c. Let it dry per paint label (usually a few hours).  \n   d. Lightly sand between coats with 220-grit for the smoothest finish. Remove dust.  \n   e. Apply a second (and if needed, a third) coat.\n\n8. Clean up  \n   a. Remove painter\u2019s tape while the last coat is still just tacky to avoid peeling.  \n   b. Reattach hardware once the paint is fully cured.  \n   c. Clean brushes or rollers according to paint type.\n\nTips  \n\u2022 Work in moderate temperatures (50\u201380\u00b0F) with good ventilation.  \n\u2022 If you\u2019re short on time, a high-build primer\u2013paint combo can cut it down to a single application\u2014but you\u2019ll still need good surface prep.  \n\u2022 For best durability in high-traffic areas, choose a semi-gloss or satin enamel.\n\nFollowing these steps will give you crisp, long-lasting painted trim with no stain bleed or peeling.

Gather tools & materials  \n   \u2022 Drop cloths or old sheets  \n   \u2022 Painter\u2019s tape (\u00bc\"\u20131\"-wide for fine lines)  \n   \u2022 Putty knife + spackling compound (for filling nail holes)  \n   \u2022 Sandpaper (120\u2013220-grit)  \n   \u2022 Mild detergent or TSP substitute  \n   \u2022 Primer (if you\u2019re making a big color change or painting bare wood)  \n   \u2022 Paint (you\u2019ll need two colors if you want contrast above/below the rail plus any rail color)  \n   \u2022 Angled sash brush (2\u20132\u00bd\")  \n   \u2022 Mini rollers (4\"\u20136\") with a smooth or light-nap cover  \n   \u2022 Small roller tray  \n\n2. Prep the room  \n   a. Move furniture out or center and cover with drop cloths.  \n   b. Lay drop cloths on the floor, especially along the walls.  \n   c. Remove outlet and switch covers; take down wall hangings.  \n   d. Clean walls & chair rail with a mild detergent to remove grease/dust. Let dry fully.  \n\n3. Repair & sand  \n   a. Fill nail holes or dents with spackling.  \n   b. Once the spackle dries, sand smooth.  \n   c. Lightly sand the chair rail and the wall where you plan to tape, to give paint better \u201ctooth.\u201d Wipe away dust with a damp cloth.  \n\n4. Prime (if needed)  \n   \u2022 If the existing paint is glossy, stained, or you\u2019re going from a dark to a light color, apply a coat of primer on walls and rail.  \n   \u2022 Let the primer dry completely per label instructions.  \n\n5. Decide your painting order  \n   Option A: Paint the chair rail first, then walls  \n   Option B: Paint walls first, then rail  \n   Both work; many pros prefer Option A so you can tape over the rail once it\u2019s painted and get a clean wall\u2010to\u2010rail line.  \n\n6. Painting the chair rail (Option A)  \n   a. Using your angled sash brush, cut in on all surfaces of the rail (top, bottom, face).  \n   b. Feather out brush strokes so the paint is even.  \n   c. If you\u2019re using a third color for the rail, let that dry fully (check the can for dry time).  \n   d. Apply a second coat if coverage isn\u2019t perfect. Let dry.  \n   e. Apply painter\u2019s tape along the top and bottom edge of the rail\u2014press firmly to seal.  \n\n7. Painting the walls  \n   a. With tape in place, use an angled brush to \u201ccut in\u201d around the ceiling line, corners and the taped edges at the rail.  \n   b. Pour your wall color into a roller tray and roll the larger field of the wall with your mini roller. Work in 4\u20135-foot sections, rolling top to bottom in a \u201cW\u201d or \u201cM\u201d pattern, then fill in.  \n   c. Maintain a wet edge to avoid lap marks.  \n   d. Let the first coat dry, then apply a second coat if needed.  \n\n8. Clean up tape & finishing touches  \n   a. Once your topcoat is dry to the touch (often after an hour but check your paint\u2019s label), carefully peel off tape at a 45\u00b0 angle.  \n   b. Touch up any small bleeds or imperfections with a small brush.  \n   c. Reinstall outlet covers and return furniture.  \n\nTips & Variations  \n\u2022 If you want the chair rail to match the trim (door/window casings), use the same paint and sheen.  \n\u2022 For an ultra-crisp line, remove the tape immediately after the last coat has dried but before it fully cures.  \n\u2022 Use a satin or semi-gloss on rails and trim for durability; eggshell or matte works well on walls.  \n\nFollowing these steps will help you achieve sharp, even lines above and below the chair rail and give your room a polished, custom finish.
