Inspect & Repair  \n   \u2022 Look for loose splinters, deep cracks, rot or insect damage.  \n   \u2022 Fill shallow cracks with an exterior-grade wood filler; replace severely damaged sections before painting.\n\n2. Clean Thoroughly  \n   \u2022 Vacuum or broom off loose dust.  \n   \u2022 Scrub with a stiff nylon brush and a solution of TSP substitute or mild detergent and warm water to remove dirt, cobwebs, grease and soot.  \n   \u2022 Rinse with clean water and let the beams dry completely (24\u201348 h is typical).\n\n3. De-Gloss & Smooth Selectively  \n   \u2022 Rustic beams generally have ridges and saw marks you want to keep. Sand only where there are high splinters or hardened dirt, using 80- to 120-grit paper.  \n   \u2022 Wipe away sanding dust with a damp microfiber cloth.\n\n4. Mask Surroundings  \n   \u2022 Use painter\u2019s tape and plastic sheeting to protect ceilings, walls and floors.  \n   \u2022 Lay drop cloths beneath the work area.\n\n5. Prime for Adhesion & Stain Blocking  \n   \u2022 Choose a high-bond, stain-blocking primer (oil-based or a bonding acrylic/urethane hybrid). These seal old tannins and pitch that could bleed through paint.  \n   \u2022 Apply with a 2\u00bd\u20133 in. stiff-bristle brush, working the primer into grooves, knots and end grain.  \n   \u2022 Allow the recommended dry time (often 2\u20134 h for an acrylic, 6\u20138 h for an oil primer).\n\n6. Caulk Gaps (Optional)  \n   \u2022 If you want a tighter, more finished look, caulk between the beam and ceiling/wall joint using a paintable, elastomeric sealant after primer is dry.\n\n7. Paint  \n   \u2022 Paint Type: A high-quality 100 % acrylic latex offers durability and low odor indoors; for historic or chalky matte looks, consider mineral or chalk paint, but seal afterward with a clear matte polyurethane if you need scrub resistance.  \n   \u2022 Sheen: Satin hides surface variations better than semi-gloss yet still wipes clean.  \n   \u2022 Application: Use the same stiff-bristle brush or a 4-in. \u201cjumbo\u201d brush. Work paint into recesses first, then drag along the grain to even out brush marks. Two thin coats are better than one thick coat; allow proper dry time between coats (usually 2\u20134 h).\n\n8. Optional Topcoat  \n   \u2022 For damp locations or heavy traffic areas, finish with a clear, water-based polyurethane or acrylic urethane in matte or satin. Let the paint cure at least 24 h before top-coating.\n\n9. Cleanup & Curing  \n   \u2022 Remove tape while paint is still slightly tacky to avoid cracking the paint line.  \n   \u2022 Cure time before heavy use or cleaning: roughly 7 days for most latex paints.\n\nHelpful Product Picks at Zava  \n   \u2022 Zava Pro-Bond Interior/Exterior Primer-Sealer (oil or acrylic versions)  \n   \u2022 Z-Flex 100 % Acrylic Latex Paint, Satin, custom color match available  \n   \u2022 Zava \u2018Rustic-Edge\u2019 3-in.

Kill and remove any active mildew  \n   \u2022 Mix your bleach solution or use a premixed fungicidal wash.  \n   \u2022 Wet the surface, scrub lightly, then let the solution sit for 10\u201315 min.  \n   \u2022 Rinse with clean water and let the area dry completely (overnight is ideal).\n\n2. Wash the paint film  \n   \u2022 Even if it looks clean, mildew-resistant coatings accumulate soap scum, cooking oils or cigarette residue that can interfere with adhesion.  \n   \u2022 Use a TSP substitute or mild detergent, rinse, and allow to dry.\n\n3. Scuff-sand / degloss  \n   \u2022 Buff the entire painted surface with 120- or 150-grit.

Finish coat(s)  \n   \u2022 Apply one or two coats of a quality 100 % acrylic paint. If the room is moisture-prone (bath, laundry, coastal porch), choose a mildew-resistant version again for added protection.  \n   \u2022 Maintain the \u201cwet edge\u201d as you roll, and back-roll in sections to avoid lap marks.  \n   \u2022 Respect the recoat window\u2014usually 2\u20134 hrs for latex.\n\n7. Cure & care  \n   \u2022 Full cure for latex is about 7 days.

Feel free to adjust the steps to suit your project or available tools.\n\n1. Inspect and repair the brickwork\n   \u2022 Look for cracks, crumbling mortar, efflorescence (white powder) or mildew.  \n   \u2022 Patch any holes or cracks with interior-grade mortar repair or acrylic caulk. Allow repairs to cure fully (check product label; often 24 h).  \n   \u2022 If the brick is damp, trace and fix the source first\u2014paint will not adhere properly to moisture-laden masonry.\n\n2. Clean thoroughly\n   \u2022 Vacuum or dry-brush off loose dust and grit.  \n   \u2022 Wash the surface with warm water, mild detergent and a stiff nylon brush. For greasy soot (e.g., near a fireplace) add TSP substitute or degreaser.  \n   \u2022 Rinse well and let the wall dry at least 24 h; brick is porous and must be completely dry before priming.\n\n3. Mask and protect surroundings\n   \u2022 Cover floors with drop cloths; tape off adjacent walls, trim, outlets and fixtures with painter\u2019s tape.  \n   \u2022 If the brick meets a finished floor, run a bead of painter\u2019s caulk to seal gaps and stop paint bleed.\n\n4. Choose the right primer\n   \u2022 Use a high-quality masonry or multi-surface bonding primer.  \n   \u2022 If stain or soot is present, a stain-blocking primer (acrylic or shellac) prevents bleed-through.  \n   \u2022 For very porous, raw brick, consider a block-filler primer to even out the surface and reduce paint consumption.\n\n5. Prime the wall\n   \u2022 Stir the primer well; pour into a paint tray.  \n   \u2022 Cut in edges and mortar lines with a 2\u20132\u00bd in (50\u201365 mm) synthetic brush.  \n   \u2022 Roll the larger faces with a \u00bd\u2013\u00be in (12\u201319 mm) nap roller or a smaller \u201chot dog\u201d roller for tight spots.  \n   \u2022 Work the primer into crevices; back-brush while wet if necessary.  \n   \u2022 Allow to dry as directed (usually 1\u20134 h for acrylic primers).\n\n6. Select a paint formulated for masonry\n   \u2022 Interior 100 % acrylic latex paint is the most common.  \n   \u2022 Choose sheen:  \n       \u2013 Flat or matte hides surface irregularities.  \n       \u2013 Eggshell or satin is more scrubbable for high-traffic areas.  \n   \u2022 If near a fireplace opening, use a high-heat paint within the firebox and regular latex on the facing (check temperature limits on the can).  \n   \u2022 Plan on two coats for uniform coverage.\n\n7. Apply the paint\n   \u2022 Stir well; do not thin unless product label allows.  \n   \u2022 Cut in first, then roll large areas\u2014same tools as for primer.  \n   \u2022 Maintain a wet edge and work the paint into mortar joints.  \n   \u2022 Wait the recommended recoat time (usually 2\u20134 h) before the second coat.  \n   \u2022 A third coat may be necessary on very dark or rough brick.\n\n8. Final touches\n   \u2022 Remove painter\u2019s tape while the last coat is still slightly tacky to reduce peeling.  \n   \u2022 Touch up any missed mortar joints with a small brush.  \n   \u2022 Let the paint cure (about 7 days for latex) before aggressive scrubbing or hanging d\u00e9cor.\n\nHelpful extras available at Zava\n   \u2022 Zava-Prime Masonry Sealer/Primer (1 gal, covers ~250 sq ft on rough brick)  \n   \u2022 Zava 100 % Acrylic Interior Wall & Trim Paint, Eggshell finish  \n   \u2022 \u00be in shed-resistant roller covers, stiff nylon brick brush, low-tack painter\u2019s tape  \n   \u2022 Ready-to-use TSP-Free Wall Cleaner and Safety Kit (gloves, goggles, mask)  \n\nTip: Keep a small labeled jar of touch-up paint sealed tightly.

Choose the right paint  \n   \u2022 Look for low- or zero-VOC (volatile organic compound) interior paint. It reduces fumes that can irritate pets\u2019 respiratory systems.  \n   \u2022 Opt for an eggshell or satin finish for walls; they\u2019re easier to clean if muddy paws or wet noses touch them later.  \n   \u2022 Speak with a Zava paint specialist if you need help matching colors or picking a pet-friendly brand.\n\n2. Gather supplies up front  \n   \u2022 Paint, primer (if needed)  \n   \u2022 Rollers, brushes, extension pole  \n   \u2022 Painter\u2019s tape, drop cloths or plastic sheeting  \n   \u2022 Paint tray liners, stirring sticks  \n   \u2022 Disposable gloves and a respirator or high-quality mask for you  \n   \u2022 A door sweep, baby gate or temporary pet barrier\n\n3. Create a safe, separate zone for pets  \n   \u2022 Select a room farthest from the area you\u2019ll paint.  \n   \u2022 Move their food, water, bedding and toys there.  \n   \u2022 Close doors and use a baby gate if needed. Birds are especially sensitive to fumes\u2014move their cage to a different floor if possible.\n\n4. Prep the room quickly and thoroughly  \n   \u2022 Remove or cover furniture with plastic sheeting.  \n   \u2022 Fill nail holes and sand lightly\u2014wipe dust with a damp cloth.  \n   \u2022 Tape off trim, outlets and switches.  \n   \u2022 Lay down drop cloths to keep fur off fresh paint and prevent slips.\n\n5. Ventilation is critical  \n   \u2022 Open windows and use fans to exhaust air outward. Place one fan facing out of a window and another drawing fresh air in.  \n   \u2022 Close HVAC vents in that room so fumes don\u2019t circulate through the ductwork.\n\n6. Paint efficiently  \n   \u2022 \u201cCut in\u201d edges with a brush first, then roll the larger areas.  \n   \u2022 Work from top (ceiling line) down to baseboards, and paint one wall at a time to keep a wet edge.  \n   \u2022 Keep paint lids closed when not in use to limit odor.\n\n7. Monitor dry-time & fumes before reintroducing pets  \n   \u2022 Most low-VOC paints are dry to the touch in 1\u20132 hours and ready for a second coat in 4\u20136, but they can off-gas for up to 24\u201348 hours.  \n   \u2022 Wait until paint is fully dry and the smell has dissipated before letting pets back in\u2014overnight is a good rule of thumb.  \n   \u2022 If weather allows, continue ventilating for an extra day.\n\n8. Post-paint cleanup  \n   \u2022 Seal brushes and rollers in plastic between coats or wash them promptly with mild soap and warm water if using water-based paint.  \n   \u2022 Remove painter\u2019s tape at a 45\u00b0 angle while paint is slightly tacky to avoid peeling.  \n   \u2022 Store leftover paint in an airtight can, clearly labeled. Keep it on a high shelf or locked cabinet away from curious animals.\n\n9. Quick tips for specific animals  \n   \u2022 Dogs/Cats: Provide chew toys or puzzle feeders in their safe room to reduce anxiety from unfamiliar noises.  \n   \u2022 Birds: Even low-VOC paints can produce particulates that irritate their lungs; relocating them to a friend\u2019s house is ideal.  \n   \u2022 Small mammals (rabbits, hamsters): Cover their enclosures with breathable cloth and place an air purifier nearby if relocation isn\u2019t possible.\n\n10. What to watch for  \n    \u2022 If a pet accidentally steps in wet paint, rinse paws with lukewarm water and mild dish soap\u2014most latex paints are water-based and non-toxic in small amounts, but ingestion can cause mild digestive upset. Contact a vet if you\u2019re unsure.  \n    \u2022 For oil-based or specialty paints, keep the emergency vet\u2019s number handy; solvents can be harmful if ingested or inhaled.\n\nNeed supplies or color samples?

Acid-cured \u201cSwedish\u201d CONVERSION VARNISH\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n\u2022 Durability: Hard, chemically resistant, almost as tough as aluminum-oxide.  \n\u2022 Drawbacks: Very high VOCs (strong odor), flammable fumes, specialized respirators required, tricky pot-life (must be used within a few hours of mixing). For that reason it\u2019s almost always applied by a pro.  \n\u2022 DIY suitability: Generally not recommended unless you have pro experience and protective gear.\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n3.

Slightly softer than the options above but still the \u201cworkhorse\u201d finish in North America. Adds a warm amber tone that many people like.  \n\u2022 Cure time: Tack-free in 8\u201312 h; full cure 2\u20133 weeks.  \n\u2022 DIY suitability: Straightforward; longest open time, which gives beginners a little forgiveness.\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n5.

Lower VOC and faster drying (2\u20134 h between coats), but because it doesn\u2019t have a separate hardener it tops out a bit softer.  \n\u2022 Best use: Light-to-medium traffic rooms or when you want minimal color change.\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n6.

Historically popular but not what you\u2019d choose primarily for longevity.\n\nSo, \u201cmost durable\u201d in practical terms:\n\n\u2022 Buying new flooring: Choose boards with a factory UV-cured aluminum-oxide topcoat.  \n\u2022 Site-finishing and willing to pay a pro: Acid-cured conversion varnish.  \n\u2022 High-end DIY or pro with lower fumes: Two-component water-borne polyurethane (Bona Traffic HD, Loba 2K, Pall-X Power, etc.).  \n\u2022 Budget-friendly DIY that still lasts: Traditional oil-based polyurethane (Minwax Super Fast-Drying Poly, Varathane Professional, Zava-brand ProShield Oil Poly).\n\nApplication tips for long life (regardless of product):\n\n1. Sand to at least 100\u2013120 grit and vacuum thoroughly.  \n2. Follow the manufacturer\u2019s recommended number of coats\u2014usually three for polys (one sealer + two build coats).  \n3. Maintain film thickness: don\u2019t \u201cstretch\u201d a gallon; aim for about 500 ft\u00b2 per gallon per coat for water-borne, 350\u2013400 ft\u00b2 for oil-based.  \n4. Respect cure times before putting rugs or furniture back.  \n5. Add felt pads and a good entry mat system to preserve your hard work.\n\nNeed product sheets or applicators?

Here\u2019s a complete process that works for both indoor decor pieces and outdoor planters.\n\n-------------------------------------------------\n1. Gather your materials\n\u2022 Mild dish soap and a scrub brush  \n\u2022 Clean rags or paper towels  \n\u2022 220-grit sandpaper (optional, for very rough pots)  \n\u2022 Sealer for porous clay (water-based masonry/terracotta sealer or an \u201call-purpose\u201d clear craft sealer)  \n\u2022 Multi-surface primer (or white acrylic/latex paint that says \u201cprimer/paint in one\u201d)  \n\u2022 Paint: acrylic craft paint, outdoor patio paint, chalk paint, or spray paint formulated for clay/ceramic  \n\u2022 Good-quality synthetic brushes or foam brushes; or aerosol cans if you prefer spraying  \n\u2022 Clear topcoat: acrylic sealer, outdoor polyurethane, or clear spray enamel (matte, satin or gloss)  \n\u2022 Drop cloth, stir sticks, disposable gloves\n\nEverything on the list is usually stocked in the paint and craft aisles at Zava.\n\n-------------------------------------------------\n2. Clean and dry the pot\n\u2022 Scrub off clay dust and any mineral deposits with warm soapy water.  \n\u2022 Rinse well; let the pot air-dry at least overnight. Terracotta must be bone-dry or moisture will push through later and cause peeling or white haze.\n\n-------------------------------------------------\n3. (Optional) Light sanding\nIf the surface is rough, knock it down with 220-grit sandpaper and wipe off the dust. A smoother pot needs less paint and gives crisper lines for taped or stenciled designs.\n\n-------------------------------------------------\n4. Seal the interior (and, if you like, the exterior)\nWhy: Terracotta is extremely porous, so it \u201cbreathes\u201d and wicks water. Sealing:  \n\u2022 Inside: Brush or spray one to two thin coats of water-based masonry/terracotta sealer. Let it soak in and dry per label (usually 1-2 h between coats, 24 h cure).  \n\u2022 Rim/Top inch of the inside: Also seal this area\u2014water often evaporates here and can push through exterior paint.  \n\u2022 Optional outside seal: Adds longevity, especially for outdoor use, but you can rely on primer alone if you prefer a weathered look.\n\n-------------------------------------------------\n5. Prime the exterior\n\u2022 Apply one thin, even coat of multi-surface primer/paint.  \n\u2022 Let it dry (30 min to 1 h for most primers).  \n\u2022 A second coat fills any last pinholes and gives a bright, level surface so colors pop.\n\n-------------------------------------------------\n6. Paint your design\nHand-painting: Use regular acrylic craft paint, outdoor patio paint or chalk paint.  \nSpray-painting: Use light passes, 8\u201312 in away, rotating the pot.  \n\u2022 Work in thin coats; heavy coats can drip or trap air.  \n\u2022 Dry time: 20\u201330 min between coats; full coverage usually takes 2\u20133 coats.  \n\u2022 For stripes, blocks or patterns, let each color dry, then use painter\u2019s tape or stencils.\n\n-------------------------------------------------\n7. Clear-coat for protection\nWhen the artwork is fully dry, seal with a clear finish:  \n\u2022 Indoor pieces: two light coats of water-based acrylic sealer or matte/satin polyurethane.  \n\u2022 Outdoor pieces: use an exterior-rated polyurethane, marine spar urethane, or a UV-resistant spray enamel.  \nHold the can 8\u201310 in away; rotate the pot for even coverage. Let each coat dry per label (usually 1\u20132 h) and cure 24\u201348 h before planting.\n\n-------------------------------------------------\n8. Planting & care tips\n\u2022 Add a coffee filter or pottery shard over the drain hole so soil doesn\u2019t clog it.  \n\u2022 Water normally; sealed/painted pots dry out a bit slower than raw terracotta, so check moisture before watering.  \n\u2022 If you ever need to clean the outside, wipe gently with a damp cloth\u2014avoid harsh scrubbing pads.\n\n-------------------------------------------------\nQuick reference timing\nDay 1: Wash pot \u2192 Dry overnight  \nDay 2: Seal interior (and exterior if desired) \u2192 Dry 24 h  \nDay 3: Prime \u2192 Paint (allow drying)  \nDay 4: Clear coat \u2192 Cure 24\u201348 h  \nDay 5\u20136: Pot your plant and enjoy!\n\nThat\u2019s it\u2014your terracotta pot should now sport a vibrant, durable finish. If you need specific materials, just let me know and I can point you to the exact aisle or brand names we carry at Zava. Happy painting!"}]}

Below is a quick hierarchy\u2014from most durable to most economical\u2014along with the key differences, pros/cons, and a few products you can find at Zava.\n\n1. Two-Part 100 % Solids Epoxy Kits  \n   \u2022 Durability: Commercial-grade\u2014stands up to hot-tire pickup, heavy jacks, and most chemicals.  \n   \u2022 Finish: High-build, glossy, 8\u201312 mil dry film. Accepts vinyl chips for texture.  \n   \u2022 Cure time: Light foot traffic 12-18 h, vehicles 48-72 h.  \n   \u2022 Prep: Requires thorough concrete cleaning, acid etch or grind, plus a moisture test.  \n   \u2022 Coverage: ~160\u2013200 sq ft per gallon.  \n   \u2022 Cost: $1.50\u2013$2.50 / sq ft installed (DIY kit).  \n   \u2022 Zava examples: Rust-Oleum Professional 100 % Solids Epoxy Kit, Quikrete 100 % Solids Epoxy Garage Coating.\n\n2. Polyurea / Polyaspartic Coatings  \n   \u2022 Durability: Similar to or slightly better than 100 % solids epoxy; superior UV resistance (won\u2019t amber).  \n   \u2022 Finish: Very high-gloss; thinner film (4\u20136 mil) unless multiple coats are applied.  \n   \u2022 Cure time: Walkable in 2\u20134 h, vehicles in 24 h\u2014fastest turnaround.  \n   \u2022 Prep: Same as epoxy (etch or diamond-grind).  \n   \u2022 Coverage: ~175\u2013225 sq ft per gallon.  \n   \u2022 Cost: $2.50\u2013$3.50 / sq ft.  \n   \u2022 Zava examples: Valspar Polyurea Garage Floor System, Rust-Oleum RockSolid Polycuramine (polyurea blend).\n\n3. 1-Part \u201cEpoxy-Acrylic\u201d Concrete Paint  \n   \u2022 Durability: Better than standard latex paint but less than two-part coatings; moderate resistance to hot-tire pickup.  \n   \u2022 Finish: Satin or semi-gloss; film build 2\u20134 mil.  \n   \u2022 Cure time: Foot traffic 24 h, vehicles 5\u20137 days.  \n   \u2022 Prep: Clean and etch; no mixing catalyst required.  \n   \u2022 Coverage: 300\u2013400 sq ft per gallon.  \n   \u2022 Cost: $0.40\u2013$0.60 / sq ft.  \n   \u2022 Zava examples: Behr Premium 1-Part Epoxy, Valspar Garage Floor Epoxy-Acrylic.\n\n4. Standard Latex Concrete Floor Paint  \n   \u2022 Durability: Adequate for light foot traffic and lawn-equipment storage; prone to hot-tire lift.  \n   \u2022 Finish: Low-sheen to satin.  \n   \u2022 Prep: Simple degrease and rinse.  \n   \u2022 Cost: $0.25\u2013$0.35 / sq ft.  \n   \u2022 Good for: Budget rentals, quick color change.\n\nChoosing Tips\n\n\u2022 Moisture test first: Tape a 2 \u00d7 2 ft plastic sheet to the slab for 24 h. If condensation forms, stick with breathable latex paint or install a vapor barrier first.  \n\u2022 Surface profile matters: A diamond grinder or acid etch (muriatic or citric) opens the pores so coatings anchor well.  \n\u2022 Temperature/\u200bhumidity: Two-part epoxies prefer 60\u201385 \u00b0F and <80 % RH. Polyurea tolerates wider ranges but still avoid direct sunlight during application.  \n\u2022 Safety: Wear a respirator while etching or mixing catalysts.  \n\u2022 Add traction: Broadcast vinyl chips or silica while the coating is wet; top-coat with clear if you want extra depth and chemical resistance.\n\nQuick \u201cWhich One Should I Get?\u201d  \n\u2022 Daily mechanic work, welding, or heavy duty: 100 % solids epoxy (add a urethane clear coat for UV/chemical protection).  \n\u2022 Want it done this weekend and park Monday: Polyurea/polyaspartic.  \n\u2022 Weekend DIY\u2019er, moderate traffic, tight budget: 1-part epoxy-acrylic.  \n\u2022 Just need gray color and dust control: Standard latex concrete paint.\n\nNeed exact quantities or matching accessory kits (etching solution, chips, rollers, spikes)?

Artist/Detail Brushes  \n   \u2022 Sizes 0\u201310 (round or flat) are ideal for corners, trim, furniture edges and tight carvings.  \n   \u2022 Choose synthetic bristles for water-based paints and natural-bristle or a synthet ic\u2013natural blend for oil-based paints or varnishes.\n\n2. Angled Sash Brush (\u00bd\"\u20131\")  \n   \u2022 The angled tips help \u201ccut in\u201d around window frames, skirting boards and switch plates.  \n   \u2022 Holds more paint than an artist brush, so it speeds up linear runs such as narrow moldings.\n\n3. Foam Brushes (1\"\u20133\")  \n   \u2022 Inexpensive and disposable\u2014great for touch-ups, stain, polyurethane or when you don\u2019t want brush marks.  \n   \u2022 Not suitable for rough surfaces or heavy, repeated use.\n\n4. Mini (4\" or 6\") Foam Rollers  \n   \u2022 Best for flat, smooth panels\u2014cabinet doors, shelves or radiator covers.  \n   \u2022 Produce an even, lint-free finish without brush strokes.\n\n5.
