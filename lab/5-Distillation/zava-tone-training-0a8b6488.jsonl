Flat / Matte  \n   \u2022 Best at hiding surface flaws because it scatters light instead of reflecting it.  \n   \u2022 Touch-ups blend in easily.  \n   \u2022 Drawback: more prone to scuffs and harder to scrub, so reserve it for low-traffic areas (bedrooms, formal living or dining rooms, ceilings).\n\n2. Matte \u201cwashable\u201d or \u201cscrubbable\u201d finishes  \n   \u2022 Newer premium products give you the same low sheen but a tougher resin for easier cleaning.  \n   \u2022 Ideal if you want the concealment of flat paint but need a bit of durability.\n\n3. Eggshell (low-sheen)  \n   \u2022 A compromise when you need some washability in hallways or family rooms yet still want to mute minor imperfections.  \n   \u2022 Slightly more reflective than flat, so deep dents or ridges may show if the light rakes across the wall.\n\nTips for even better coverage:\n\u2022 Use a high-build or \u201cself-priming\u201d paint: thick formulations fill small surface voids.  \n\u2022 Prime repaired spots first; raw compound can flash (look dull) under finish paint.  \n\u2022 Apply with a quality \u215c\"\u2013\u00bd\" nap roller for a subtle uniform texture that further masks flaws.  \n\u2022 Keep lighting in mind: side-lighting (from windows or sconces) makes imperfections more noticeable; consider window treatments or different fixture placement.\n\nSo, for maximum concealment, choose a premium flat or washable matte finish. Move up to eggshell only if you need extra durability in a busier space."}]}

If you\u2019d like more detail on any step or product, just let me know!\n\n1. Pick the right base: Oil-based vs. Water-based\n   \u2022 Oil-based (also called \u201calkyd\u201d or \u201cpenetrating oil\u201d): Soaks deep into the wood, highlights grain, excellent water-beading, and easy to spot-repair. Needs mineral-spirit cleanup and will darken slightly over time.  \n   \u2022 Water-based acrylic: Lower odor, soap-and-water cleanup, good UV resistance, and keeps lighter colors truer. Dries faster but doesn\u2019t penetrate quite as deeply as oil.\n\n2. Choose the opacity level\n   \u2022 Clear/Translucent: Shows the most grain but offers the least UV protection\u2014good only if you\u2019re okay re-coating every year.  \n   \u2022 Semi-Transparent: Our most common recommendation\u2014enough color particles to block UV while still showing grain. Expect 2\u20133 years before a maintenance coat.  \n   \u2022 Solid-Color: Paint-like coverage that hides most grain but delivers the longest protection (4\u20135 years). Great for older furniture with color inconsistencies.\n\n3. Look for these exterior-grade additives on the label\n   \u2022 UV inhibitors (often listed as \u201ctrans-oxide pigments\u201d or \u201cUV absorbers\u201d).  \n   \u2022 Mildewcides/fungicides (especially important in humid or shaded locations).  \n   \u2022 Water-repellent resins or oil blends.  \n\n4. Don\u2019t forget your wood species\n   \u2022 Hardwoods (teak, ipe, mahogany): A specialized hardwood oil such as Penofin Hardwood Formula or Cabot Australian Timber Oil penetrates dense grain more effectively.  \n   \u2022 Softwoods (cedar, pine, fir): A water-based acrylic-oil hybrid like BEHR Premium Semi-Transparent or Valspar One-Coat Exterior allows the softer grain to absorb more finish.\n\n5. Zava staff-favorites (all stock items)\n   \u2022 Cabot Australian Timber Oil (oil, semi-transparent): Great warmth, excellent on teak and mahogany.  \n   \u2022 DEFY Extreme Semi-Transparent (water-based): Uses nano-zinc UV blockers; very good color retention and mildew resistance.  \n   \u2022 Olympic Maximum Stain + Sealant (water-based or oil\u2014your choice): One-day, clean-and-stain formula that performs well in wet climates.  \n   \u2022 Sikkens ProLuxe (oil-alkyd): A high-build \u201ccetol\u201d finish often chosen for high-end cedar furniture when you want a furniture-grade look outdoors.\n\nApplication tips in one minute\n   1. Power-wash or scrub with an oxygen-bleach cleaner; let wood dry to below 15% moisture.  \n   2. Sand rough spots (120-150 grit) and wipe off dust.  \n   3. Stir (don\u2019t shake) the stain so pigment is evenly distributed.  \n   4. Apply with a natural-bristle brush, pad, or sprayer followed by back-brushing. Work boards end-to-end to avoid lap marks.  \n   5. Wipe away excess after 10\u201315 minutes (for oils) to prevent a sticky film.  \n   6. Let cure 24\u201348 hours before using the furniture.  \n\nBottom line\nA semi-transparent, exterior-rated stain with both water repellency and UV inhibitors usually delivers the best balance of grain visibility and long-term protection. Oil-based formulas still excel at richness and ease of touch-ups, while modern water-based products have closed the durability gap and clean up easier. Your climate, wood species, and desired look will tip the scales one way or the other.\n\nNeed help matching a color or figuring out how much you\u2019ll need?

Remove excess paint\n   \u2022 Scrape the brush on the lip of the paint can.  \n   \u2022 Wipe the bristles on newspaper or a disposable rag until very little paint comes off.\n\n2. Pre-rinse in the first container of solvent\n   \u2022 Pour 1\u20132\u2033 (3\u20135 cm) of the solvent recommended on the paint can\u2014typically mineral spirits, paint thinner, or turpentine\u2014into a metal or glass container.  \n   \u2022 Swirl and press the bristles against the bottom to work the paint out.  \n   \u2022 Comb the bristles with a brush comb or a disposable fork to free trapped pigment.\n\n3. Repeat in a clean batch (or two) of solvent\n   \u2022 Move the brush to fresh solvent and repeat until the liquid stays mostly clear.  \n   \u2022 For very stubborn colors, a dedicated brush cleaner such as Krud Kutter Brush-Wash or Klean-Strip Brush-Cleaner can speed things up.\n\n4. Wash with soap and water\n   \u2022 Massage a few drops of dish soap or a specialty brush soap into the bristles.  \n   \u2022 Rinse in warm running water, squeezing from ferrule (the metal band) to tip.  \n   \u2022 Continue until the rinse water is completely clear.\n\n5. Final rinse and condition (optional but helpful)\n   \u2022 Give the brush a last dip in clean water mixed with a teaspoon of white vinegar or fabric softener; it neutralizes residual alkyds and keeps bristles supple.\n\n6. Dry and store\n   \u2022 Shake out excess water or spin the brush in a brush spinner.  \n   \u2022 Gently reshape the bristles with your fingers.  \n   \u2022 Lay the brush flat or hang it by the handle hole so water can\u2019t seep into the ferrule.  \n   \u2022 Once dry, slip it back into the original sleeve or wrap it in heavy paper to maintain its form.\n\nSafety & disposal\n\u2022 Work in a well-ventilated area, away from ignition sources\u2014solvents are flammable.  \n\u2022 Wear chemical-resistant gloves and eye protection.  \n\u2022 Let used solvent sit in a sealed jar; paint solids will settle to the bottom overnight. Strain the clear solvent back into a clean container for reuse and take the sludge to a hazardous-waste facility or a paint-recycling drop-off. Never pour it down a drain.\n\nTip for short breaks\nIf you\u2019ll resume painting within a day or two, skip full cleaning: suspend the brush in a small container of clean mineral spirits with the bristles fully immersed, or tightly wrap the bristles in plastic wrap and refrigerate. Clean thoroughly when you\u2019re finished with the project.\n\nFollow these steps and your oil-based brushes will stay soft, maintain their shape, and deliver a smooth finish for years to come."}]}

Clean: Lightly wipe the area with a damp, soapy cloth to remove dust, oil or fingerprints. Let it dry completely.  \n2. Repair:  \n   \u2022 For pinholes or shallow nicks: dab a bit of spackle with your fingertip, scrape flush with the putty knife.  \n   \u2022 For nail or screw holes: overfill slightly with spackle, let it dry, then sand smooth.  \n3. Sand: Feather the edges using fine-grit sandpaper so the patched spot is level with the surrounding paint film. Wipe away dust with a dry cloth.\n\n\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\n3.

Remember that the final sheen appears after 1\u20132 hours.\n\n\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\n5.

Lightly dab (do not brush in long strokes) to stipple paint only on the blemish. Try to stay inside the original area.\n\nFor patches up to roughly a credit-card size:\n\u2022 A 1- to 2-inch angle sash brush works well. Feather the edges: place the brush in the center, then gently sweep outward so paint thins toward the edges. This helps blend with the surrounding film.\n\nFor larger areas (softball-size or bigger):\n\u2022 A 4-inch high-density foam mini roller typically gives the closest match to the original roller texture. Load the roller lightly, roll off excess on a tray, then roll over the patch and 2\u20133 inches beyond in a \u201cW\u201d or criss-cross pattern.\n\nPro tip: If the wall has an orange-peel or knockdown texture, you can mimic it by tapping a slightly loaded sponge or roller before the paint dries.\n\n\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\n6.

Keep application thin and even.  \n\u2022 Evaluate under the same lighting that normally hits the wall. A spot that looks perfect under warm evening light may flash (look different) in midday sun.\n\n\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\n7.

Paint usually darkens as it dries; initial contrast often fades.  \n\u2022 After 2\u20134 hours (or the time listed on your paint can), check the result. If it still shows, a second light coat\u2014slightly larger than the first\u2014will often disappear.\n\n\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\n8.
