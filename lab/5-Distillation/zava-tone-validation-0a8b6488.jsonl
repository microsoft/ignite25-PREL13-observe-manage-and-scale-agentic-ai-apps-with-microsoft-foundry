Everything on the list can be found in the paint and electrical aisles at Zava.\n\n1. De-energize the circuit  \n   \u2022 Turn the breaker for that outlet OFF, then plug in a lamp or tester to confirm the power is out.  \n   \u2022 Even though you\u2019re only removing a plastic cover, treating the box as \u201clive\u201d until you prove otherwise is the safest habit.\n\n2. Remove the cover plate  \n   \u2022 Back out the single center screw and set the plate and screw in a zip-top bag so they don\u2019t get splattered or lost.  \n   \u2022 Leave the receptacle itself mounted; you only need the faceplate off.\n\n3. Mask the receptacle body  \n   \u2022 Tear a small piece of painter\u2019s tape (blue or green) and press it over the outlet/switch openings to keep paint off the slots.  \n   \u2022 Optionally run a ring of tape around the metal strap if you plan on brushing up close.\n\n4. Cut in with an angled sash brush  \n   \u2022 A 1\u00bd\u20132\u2033 high-quality angled brush (e.g., a Zava ProEdge 2\u2033) gives better control than a roller right next to the box.  \n   \u2022 Feather the edge toward the outlet; don\u2019t overload the brush. Two lighter coats look neater than one heavy pass.\n\n5. Roll the open wall area  \n   \u2022 After that 3- to 4-inch band is brushed in, you can finish the wall with a \u215c\u2033 or \u00bd\u2033 nap roller.  \n   \u2022 Keep the roller sleeve moving away from the outlet so splatter doesn\u2019t bounce back onto it.\n\n6. Pull tape while paint is still tacky  \n   \u2022 Removing painter\u2019s tape before the paint fully cures gives the cleanest line. Pull at a 45\u00b0 angle.\n\n7. Reinstall the cover plate  \n   \u2022 Once the final coat is dry to the touch, peel off any receptacle tape, reinstall the plate, and turn the breaker back on.  \n   \u2022 If you want a professional look, wipe the plate with a damp cloth first\u2014fingerprints show up fast on a fresh wall.\n\nExtra tips  \n\u2022 Need gap-filling? If there\u2019s a big drywall recess around the box, skim a little lightweight spackle and let it dry before painting.  \n\u2022 Paint-able outlet covers exist if you\u2019d like them to disappear into the wall color. Zava stocks both paint-able and decorative metal options.  \n\u2022 Never paint the actual receptacle or switch toggles\u2014besides looking sloppy, dried paint can interfere with plug contact and void UL listings.\n\nWith a shut-off breaker, painter\u2019s tape, and a steady hand, you can get razor-sharp lines in just a few minutes per outlet. Good luck with your project, and let us know if you need any brushes, tape, or testers\u2014happy to point you to the right shelf!"}]}

Gather the right tools and materials  \n   \u2022 Medium-nap roller (\u00be in.) for light texture; long-nap (1\u20131\u00bc in.) for heavy texture  \n   \u2022 Quality angled sash brush (2\u20132\u00bd in.) for cutting in  \n   \u2022 Pole extension for the roller  \n   \u2022 Sturdy paint tray and liners  \n   \u2022 Painter\u2019s tape and drop cloths  \n   \u2022 Spackle/patch compound for repairs  \n   \u2022 120- to 150-grit sandpaper or sanding sponge  \n   \u2022 Tack cloth or microfiber cloth  \n   \u2022 High-build or \u201cself-priming\u201d primer (optional but recommended if walls are unpainted, patched, or drastically changing color)  \n   \u2022 Interior latex or acrylic paint (eggshell or satin hides texture better than flat or high gloss)  \n   \u2022 Safety gear: goggles, mask, gloves\n\n2. Prep the room  \n   \u2022 Clear or cover furniture, and protect floors with drop cloths.  \n   \u2022 Mask trim, outlets, and switches with painter\u2019s tape.  \n\n3. Clean the walls  \n   \u2022 Dust textured walls with a vacuum brush or dry microfiber cloth.  \n   \u2022 For greasy areas (kitchens, near light switches), wipe with a mild detergent solution, rinse, and let dry completely.\n\n4. Repair damaged texture (if needed)  \n   \u2022 Fill holes or gouges with spackle. Let dry, then lightly sand smooth without flattening the surrounding texture.  \n   \u2022 Wipe away sanding dust with a tack cloth.\n\n5. Sand high spots lightly  \n   \u2022 Run 120- to 150-grit over the wall to knock down overly sharp peaks. This helps the roller glide and prevents them from breaking off later.\n\n6. Prime (strongly recommended)  \n   \u2022 High-build primers fill minor crevices and seal porous spots, so final paint coats stay even.  \n   \u2022 Cut in corners/edges with the angled brush, then roll the primer from top to bottom, overlapping passes in a \u201cW\u201d pattern.  \n   \u2022 Allow primer to dry per the manufacturer\u2019s time (usually 2\u20134 hours).\n\n7. Choose the right paint technique  \n   \u2022 Load the roller fully\u2014textured walls absorb more paint.  \n   \u2022 Roll in a large \u201cW\u201d or \u201cM\u201d shape, then fill it in without lifting the roller to maintain a wet edge.  \n   \u2022 Apply firm, even pressure to push paint into crevices.  \n   \u2022 Back-roll immediately (go over the same section lightly in one direction) to level ridges left by the first pass.\n\n8. Work in sections  \n   \u2022 On textured walls, paint can dry quickly on the peaks. Working in 3\u20134 ft. sections helps keep edges wet and avoids lap marks.\n\n9. Check for misses and stipple buildup  \n   \u2022 Use a work light at a low angle to identify thin spots or heavy roller ridges and touch up while the paint is still workable.\n\n10. Apply a second coat  \n   \u2022 Most textures need 2 coats for full coverage. Allow the first to dry per the label (often 2\u20134 hours) before re-coating.\n\n11. Remove tape and clean up  \n   \u2022 Pull painter\u2019s tape off at a 45\u00b0 angle while the last coat is still slightly damp; this reduces peeling.  \n   \u2022 Wash brushes and rollers immediately if you\u2019ll reuse them.\n\nExtra tips  \n\u2022 Don\u2019t thin the paint unless the manufacturer explicitly allows it; thinning can cause drips that accentuate bumps.  \n\u2022 If the texture is very deep (e.g., knockdown or heavy stucco), a \u215c-in. specialty \u201cslit foam\u201d or \u201chigh capacity\u201d roller sleeve pushes paint deeper than a fabric nap.  \n\u2022 For ceilings with texture (popcorn or orange-peel), use the same nap recommendations but keep the roller at a slight angle to prevent splatter.  \n\u2022 Consider a paint-sprayer if the texture is extremely rough and you need to cover large areas quickly. Follow with a light back-roll to even out the finish.\n\nWith the right prep and the right roller nap, you\u2019ll get an even, professional-looking result\u2014even on surfaces with plenty of peaks and valleys. Good luck, and let us know if you need help choosing specific products!"}]}
