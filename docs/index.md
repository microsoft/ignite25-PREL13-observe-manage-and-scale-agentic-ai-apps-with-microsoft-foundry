# Learn How To Observe, Manage, and Scale, Agentic AI Apps Using Azure

!!! info "ABSTRACT"

    This hands-on workshop will provide participants with the skills to effectively manage, govern, and scale agentic AI applications using Azure and Azure AI Foundry.

Participants will engage in practical exercises to apply these concepts in real-world scenarios.

    **Level:** 300-400 <br/>
    **Duration:** 4 hours

## Application Scenario

You are an AI engineer at Zava, an enterprise retail store specializing in home improvement goods for DIY enthusiasts. Your team is building **Cora**, a shopping assistant AI to answer customer queries in-store and online. You have three requirements:

1. Cora's responses must reflect the Zava brand with a custom tone & style
1. Cora should be cost-effective to deploy given the simple, narrow task
1. Cora should support end-to-end observability for trustworthy AI operation

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this session, you will be able to

- Build and deploy an agentic AI retail chatbot on Azure AI Foundry
- Evaluate the quality, safety & agentic efficacy of chatbot operation
- Fine-Tune the chatbot model to customize tone & style of response
- Distill chatbot behavior to a smaller model for cost-effective operation
- Trace and monitor chatbot operations to detect & debug performance issues
- Understand how Azure AI Foundry enables end-to-end observability for AI 

## Session Outline

This 4-hour workshop is organized into "labs" to allow for potential breaks in between.

Each lab is designed to cover a focused topic that you should be able to complete in under 25 minutes. Labs are grouped into two tracks:

 - **Core Labs** - these cover the primary objectives for the session
 - **More Labs** - these cover bonus topics or tools for developers

We recommend completing the Core Labs in order, then selecting one or more of the bonus labs to explore if time permits. **By the end of this lab, you will have a personal fork of this repo** - and can revisit and continue learning on your own, with your own Azure subscription.
