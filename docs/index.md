## 2. About The Workshop

This is a 4-hour workshop that is broken up into smaller labs that should be completed in order. 

The workshop is organized into two tracks: **Core Labs** that cover the learning objectives outlined below, and **More Labs** that provide additional content for exploration if time permits. _You are encouraged to revisit the More Labs section in self-guided mode, at home_.

### 2.1 What are we building?

Zava is an enterprise retail store that specializes in home improvement goods for DIY enthusiasts. You are an AI engineer tasked with building **Cora**, the new customer support AI chatbot for Zava customers. 

To unlock business value, Zava sets three requirements:

1. **Be Polite & Helpful** - Cora must respond with a desired tone & style.
1. **Be Cost-Effective** - Cora should be fast to respond and cheap to operate
1. **Be Safe & Reliable** - Cora has end-to-end observability for trustworthy AI operation

In this workshop, we'll see how we can start from a basic AI Agent template - and iteratively refine model context and behavior till we get the desired _Cora AI_ experience.


### 2.2 What will we learn?

By the end of this session, you will be able to

- Build and deploy an agentic AI retail chatbot on Azure AI Foundry
- Evaluate the quality, safety & agentic efficacy of chatbot operation
- Fine-Tune the chatbot model to customize tone & style of response
