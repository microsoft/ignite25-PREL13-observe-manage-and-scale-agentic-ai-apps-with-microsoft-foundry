# 1.1 Provision Infra

!!! quote "BY THE END OF THIS LAB YOU SHOULD HAVE"

    - [X] Set your tab preference (Instructor-Led or Self-Guided)
    - [X] Launched GitHub Codespaces (and setup local environment)
    - [X] Provisioned Infrastructure (to get an Azure AI Foundry project)

---

## Before You Begin

These instructions are setup to support both instructor-led training (in-venue, with pre-provisioned subscription) and self-guided learning (at home, with your subscription). The primary difference will be in the initial setup. 

**Pick the tab that best represents you right now** ⬇️

=== "Instructor-Led (In Venue)"

    !!! info "I am currently in the Microsoft Ignite 2025 Pre-Day Workshop (4h Session)"

=== "Self-Guided (At Home)"

    !!! note "I am working through the lab at home, with my subscription (Self-Paced)"

---

<!---
We will provision the AZD "Get Started with AI Agents" template as our infrastructure. These notes correspond to [this commit](https://github.com/nitya/get-started-with-ai-agents/commit/c63e1384ae6a295b3d57378fab02ac4227bf835d) on the AZD template repo. My goal is to document the usage and customization of this template to support various projects - as pre-provisioned infrastructure.
-->

## Provision Infrastructure

By the end of this step, you should have an Azure subscription setup with the required resources for this project - which includes an Azure AI Foundry project, AI model deployments, an Azure AI Search service resource - and a default agent with a frontend app.

    ??? task "STEP 1: You need to provision the infrastructure - get the template!"

        1. Visit the [Get Started With AI Agents](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/get-started-with-ai-agents) repo 
        1. Fork it to your profile to get a custom copy (.e., [my fork-branch](https://github.com/nitya/get-started-with-ai-agents/tree/sep2025-pdy123-infra))
        1. Launch GitHub Codespaces on your fork
        1. Wait till the browser VS Code loads - and an active terminal appears.

        _You are ready to deploy the template_

    ??? task "STEP 2: You need customize template - setup env variables!"

        The azd template can be customized in many ways - the easiest starting point is to use environment variables to customize the resource deployment paramters. Run these commands in the Codespaces terminal.  _Note: Pick unique names for the last 2 variables that set the Foundry project and resource names in Azure AI Foundry Portal_

        ```bash
        azd env set AZURE_AI_AGENT_DEPLOYMENT_CAPACITY 100
        azd env set ENABLE_AZURE_MONITOR_TRACING true
        azd env set AZURE_TRACING_GEN_AI_CONTENT_RECORDING_ENABLED true
        azd env set USE_AZURE_AI_SEARCH_SERVICE true
        azd env set USE_APPLICATION_INSIGHTS true
        azd env set AZURE_AIPROJECT_NAME nitya-pdy123-aiproj-v1
        azd env set AZURE_AISERVICES_NAME nitya-pdy123-aisvcs-v1
        ```
    ??? task "STEP 3: You are ready to deploy it - have your Azure subscription ready!"

        You should already have the Azure Developer CLI (`azd`) tool installed in the GitHub Codespaces environment. Provisioning and deployment is now just a single command:

        ```title="" linenums="0"
        azd up
        ```

        Note that we did not have to authenticate beforehand! This command will prompt you to do so, using a device-code workflow that looks something like this:

        ```title="" linenums="0"
        ? Would you like to log in now? Yes

        Start by copying the next code: XXXXXXX
        Then press enter and continue to log in from your browser...
        ```

        Next you'll be prompted to select your subscription and the region for deployment. I used `East US2`. 
        
    ??? task "STEP 4: Wait for the provisioning to complete - it can take 10-15 mins!"

        You can track the deployments status in the Azure Portal (at the link you will see in your console logs). Wait for the **SUCCESS** message to ensure provisioning is done.
