    These labs complement the Cora shopping assistant scenario by exploring advanced techniques. See the [Workshop Outline](../core-labs/outline.md) for context.

Extend your Cora agent knowledge with advanced topics:

**Your goals:**

- Explore multi-agent orchestration patterns
- Deep dive into quality and safety evaluation metrics
- Learn multiple tracing frameworks (OpenAI, LangChain, LangGraph)
- Practice manual instrumentation and telemetry collection
